# Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

- Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence.
- Helps in understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of sentences.
- Done using POS taggers, which assign tags based on word context and linguistic rules.
- Example POS tags:
  - Noun (NN)
  - Verb (VB)
  - Adjective (JJ)
  - Adverb (RB)
  - Pronoun (PRP)
  - Determiner (DT)
- POS tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP).
- Used in various applications such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

# What is POS Tagging?

- The process of assigning a part-of-speech to each word in a sentence.
- It is normally a sentence-based approach.
- Given a sentence formed of a sequence of words, POS tagging tries to label (tag) each word with its correct part of speech (also named word category, word class, or lexical category).

# Difference b/w Morphological Analyzer and POS

## MA
- Finds internal structure of a word (root form, affixes, etc.)
- word-based approach
- needs smaller number of categories
- one/more analysis for a word
  e.g.
  ```plaintext
  back <back,adj,norm>
  <back,n,3,s,g,0>
  <back,adv>
  <back,v>
  ```

## POS
- assigning a POS tag to the given surface form word
- sentence-based approach
- needs a lots of categories
- one analysis for a word
  ```plaintext
  The back door = JJ (ADJ)
  On my back = NN
  Win the voters back = RB (ADV)
  Promised to back the bill = VB
  ```

# Why POS tagging?

- First step in parsing
- More tractable than full parsing, intermediate representation
- Resolves lexical ambiguity
  e.g. this
  - *This is a nice day* = **PRP**
  - *This day is nice* = **DET**
  - *You can go this far* = **ADV**
  - The POS tagging problem is to determine the POS tag for a particular instance of a word.

# Why POS tagging?

- Useful as a step for several other, more complex NLP tasks, e.g.

  - **Speech synthesis pronunciation**

    | Word       | Tag  |
    |------------|------|
    | Lead       | Lead |
    | INsult     | inSULT |
    | Object     | objECT |
    | OVERflow  | overFLOW |
    | DIScount   | disCOUNT |
    | CONtent    | conTENT |

  - **Parsing:** e.g. Time flies like an arrow
    - Is flies a N or V?

- **Word prediction in speech recognition**
  - Possessive pronouns (my, your, her) are likely to be followed by nouns
  - Personal pronouns (I, you, he) are likely to be followed by verbs

# Challenges in POS Tagging

## BS-DS IITM (BSCS5002)

### Slide 9 / 31
```

# W3-Lec8-POStagging.pdf - Page 10

# Why POS tagging is hard?

## Challenges:

- **Ambiguity: multiple category**
- In a sentence, obviously there exist some words for which more than one POS tag is possible.
  - e.g. *Can can the can*
    While disambiguating a particular word, humans exploit several mechanisms and information sources:
    - the roles of other words in the sentence,
    - the syntactic structure of the sentence,
    - the domain of the text, and
    - the world knowledge.

# Challenges

- **Garden-Path Sentences**

- **Examples:**

  - **The horse raced past the barn fell.**

    - **first interpretation:** The government is planning to raise taxes...
    - **final interpretation:** The plans of the government to raise taxes were defeated.

  - **The old man the boat**

    - **first interpretation:** The man, who is old...
    - **final interpretation:** The boat is manned by the old.

# How to Proceed?

A natural question that may arise is:
- what are these parts of speech?
- or how do we specify a set of suitable parts of speech?

Famous traditional POS tags:

- **noun**
- **verb**
- **adjective**
- **adverb**
- **pronoun**
- **preposition**
- **conjunction**
- **interjection**

What about *five*, *the*, `$`?

# Word Classes

The significance of the POS for language processing is that it gives a significant amount of information about the word and its neighbors.

Two types of Word Classes:

- **Open word classes**
  - new members are added
  - Four major open classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

- **Closed word classes**
  - Having relatively fixed membership
  - closed classes: prepositions, determiners, conjunctions etc

# W3-Lec8-POStagging.pdf - Page 15

# Open Word Classes

## (i) Nouns

Nouns are traditionally grouped into **proper nouns** and **common nouns**. **Proper nouns**: (NNP)

Rani, Kasargod, and IBM

Not preceded by articles, e.g., the book is upstairs, but (**the**) Rani is upstairs.

BS-DS IITM (BSCS5002) 15 / 31

# W3-Lec8-POStagging.pdf - Page 16

```markdown
# Common nouns: (NN)

1. **Count nouns:**
   - Allow grammatical enumeration, i.e., both singular and plural (goat/goats), and can be counted (one goat/ two goats)

2. **Mass nouns:**
   - Something is conceptualized as a homogeneous group, snow, salt, and communism.
   - Appear without articles where singular nouns cannot (Snow is white but not *Goal is white)

# Nouns of Space and Time (NST)

Nouns of space and time (NST) or adverbial nouns (Krishnamurti & Gwynn, 1985:98; Whitman, 2002:561) form a special type of nouns without number marking.

These forms also function as postpositions when they take nouns as their complements.

When they occur without noun complements, they are categorized as nouns with the following features.

(i) NST have the ability to form an oblique stem, which can be used adjectively;

(ii) NST have the ability to add case markers and postpositions to the oblique stem;

(iii) NST have the ability to add third-person pronominal suffixes to the oblique stem.

# 2. Verbs

- Most of the words referring to actions and processes including main verbs like **draw**, **provide**, **differ**, and **go**.

- A number of morphological forms: non-3rd-person-sg (**eat**), 3rd-person-sg (**eats**), progressive (**eating**), past participle (**eaten**)

```markdown
# i. Finite Verbs (VF)
A finite form is one that can stand as the main verb of a sentence and occur before a final pause (full stop).

e.g. Tam: **patittán** 'he read'

# ii. Non-finite Verbs (VNF)
A non-finite form cannot stand as a main verb and rarely occurs before a final pause.

e.g. avan **patittā** nallatu 'It is good if he reads'

# iii. Infinitive (VINF)
e.g. nān cinimā **pāṛkka vantēn** 'I came to see the cinema'

# iv. Gerund (VNG)
e.g. **cirittal utfmukku** nallatu. 'laughing is good for health'

# Tagsets

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagsets** are collections of labels used to classify words based on their grammatical roles in sentences

- **Granularity**: Need to Decide the level of granularity needed for the tagset.
  - For example, more detailed tagsets might distinguish between different types of nouns or verbs.

- **Types**:
  - **Universal tagsets**: Designed for cross-linguistic compatibility (e.g., Universal Dependencies).
  - **Standardized tagsets**: Widely accepted and used in specific languages (e.g., Penn Treebank for English).
  - **Language-specific tagsets**: Tailored for specific languages (e.g., BIS for Indian languages).

# Universal Dependencies-POS

- **Universal Dependencies(UD) POS tagset** is a standardized set of tags used for part-of-speech tagging across multiple languages.
- Developed as part of the Universal Dependencies project, it aims to provide a consistent POS tagging framework for cross-linguistic research and applications.
- It supports the development of cross-linguistic NLP tools and resources.
- **Universal Coverage**: Designed to capture syntactic and grammatical categories across different languages in a consistent manner.
- **Minimalist Approach**: Focuses on core grammatical categories to ensure broad applicability while avoiding language-specific complexities.

# Indian language Tagset: BIS

- The BIS POS tagset is specifically designed for Indian languages under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) (IS 17627 : 2021)
- It was developed to standardize POS tagging across various Indian languages.
- The tagset is multilingual and covers a wide range of Indian languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, and others.
- The BIS tagset is based on a hierarchical structure that captures both coarse-grained and fine-grained linguistic categories.
- It includes both universal categories (e.g., Nouns, Verbs) and language-specific tags to address the unique features of Indian languages.
