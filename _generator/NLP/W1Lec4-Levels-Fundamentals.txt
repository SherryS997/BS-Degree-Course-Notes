# 2. Morphological Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Morphological Analysis:** Analyzing the structure of words (prefixes, suffixes).

- **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or dictionary form. For instance, "better" is lemmatized to "good."

- **Stemming:** Cutting words to their root forms. For example, "running," "runner," and "ran" may all stem to "run."

- **Vocabulary**: The set of words available in a language or a specific domain.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 13

```markdown
# 3. Lexical Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Tokenization**: The sentence *"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."* is tokenized into:

  ```
  [The, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog]
  ```

- **Lexical Semantics**: Understanding that the word *"bank"* can mean a financial institution or the side of a river based on context.

- **Synonym Detection**: Identifying that *"happy"* and *"joyful"* convey similar meanings in sentiment analysis tasks.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 14

```markdown
# 4. Syntactic Level in NLP

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 15

```markdown
# 4. Syntactic Level in NLP

## Key Components:

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 16

```markdown
# 4. Syntactic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Parsing:** For the sentence *"The cat sat on the mat."*, parsing can show:
  ```
  [NP The cat] [VP sat [PP on [NP the mat]]]
  ```

- **Dependency Parsing:** In the sentence *"She loves him."*, dependencies can be visualized as:
  ```
  loves ← She
  loves → him
  ```

- **Grammar Rules:** Syntax can be governed by rules such as:
  - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure in English.
  - Differences in structure like Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) in Hindi.

# 5. Semantic Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**: Determining which meaning of a word is used in context.

- **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)**: Identifying the roles that words play in a sentence (e.g., agent, action, object).

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Recognizing and classifying entities in text (e.g., names, dates, locations).
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 19

# 5. Semantic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Word Sense Disambiguation**: The word "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river and WSD helps determine the correct meaning based on context (e.g., "He went to the bank to deposit money." vs. "The river bank was eroded.").

- **Semantic Role Labeling**: In the sentence "John gave Mary a book", SRL identifies:
  - Agent: John
  - Recipient: Mary
  - Theme: a book

- **Named Entity Recognition**: In the sentence "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for dollar 1 billion", NER identifies:
  - Organization: Apple
  - Location: U.K.
  - Monetary Value: dollar 1 billion

# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The discourse level in NLP deals with how sentences relate to one another in larger contexts, focusing on coherence and cohesion in language.

## Significance in NLP:

- Essential for understanding context beyond individual sentences.
- Important for tasks such as text summarization, machine translation and dialogue systems.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 21

```markdown
# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Coherence**: The logical flow of ideas in a text, ensuring that sentences connect meaningfully.

- **Cohesion**: The grammatical and lexical linking within a text that helps maintain the flow.

- **Anaphora Resolution**: Identifying which words refer back to others (e.g., resolving pronouns to their antecedents).
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 22

# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Coherence:** In the text "She went to the bakery. She bought a loaf of bread.", the ideas are coherent as the second sentence logically follows the first.

- **Cohesion:** The use of linking words such as "however," "therefore," and "moreover" helps create cohesion between sentences.

- **Anaphora Resolution:** In the sentences "John loves his dog. It follows him everywhere.", resolving "it" refers to "his dog".

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 23

# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The pragmatic level in NLP focuses on how context influences the interpretation of meaning in communication, considering the speaker's intent and the situational context.

## Significance in NLP:

- Essential for understanding implied meanings, sarcasm and conversational dynamics.
- Important for tasks such as dialogue systems, sentiment analysis and context-aware machine translation.

# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Speech Acts:** Actions performed via utterances (e.g., requests, promises, assertions).

- **Deixis:** Words and phrases (like pronouns and demonstratives) that require contextual information to convey meaning (e.g., "here," "you").

- **Contextual Understanding:** The ability to interpret meaning based on situational context and background knowledge.

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 25

# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Speech Acts:** The phrase "Can you pass the salt?" is a request, not just a question about capability.
- **Deixis:** In the sentence "I will meet you here tomorrow," the interpretation of "here" and "tomorrow" depends on the speaker's location and the current day.
- **Contextual Understanding:** In a conversation where one person says, "It's cold in here," they may be implying a request to close a window rather than just stating a fact.
