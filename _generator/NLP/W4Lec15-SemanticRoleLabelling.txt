# Introduction to Meaning Representation

- Meaning Representation involves representing the meaning of natural language in a form that machines can process and manipulate.
- It is crucial for enabling deeper understanding and inference in tasks like machine translation, question answering, and summarization.
- Two major approaches in meaning representation:
  - Logical Semantics
  - Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)

# Challenges in Meaning Representation

- **Natural language is ambiguous, context-dependent, and flexible.**
- **Meaning must be captured in a formalized, precise structure to enable:**
  - Inference
  - Reasoning
  - Question answering
- **Complexities include handling negation, quantifiers, modality, and disambiguation.**

# Logical Semantics Overview

- **Logical Semantics** is the study of meaning using formal logic.
- It provides a precise, unambiguous structure for representing sentence meaning.
- It helps us answer questions like:
  - What are the truth conditions of a sentence?
  - How do we represent meaning in a form that computers can process?
- The most common formalism is **First-Order Logic (FOL)**.

```markdown
# Components of First-Order Logic (FOL)

- **Constants**: Represent specific entities (e.g., 'John').

- **Predicates**: Express properties or relations between entities (e.g., Loves(John, Mary)).

- **Variables**: Represent arbitrary entities (e.g., ∀x, ∃y).

- **Quantifiers**: Express quantities (e.g., ∀x, ∃y).

- **Connectives**: Logical operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).

# Example of First-Order Logic (FOL)

**Sentence:** John loves Mary.

- **Logical Form:** 'Loves(John, Mary)'
- **Predicate:** 'Loves'
- **Arguments:** 'John' and 'Mary'
- **Interpretation:** This formal representation can be used for reasoning, querying, and making inferences.

# Quantifiers in First-Order Logic (FOL)

- **Universal Quantifier (∀)**: Indicates that the statement applies to all entities.

  - **Example**: All humans are mortal can be written as
    \[
    \forall x (\text{Human}(x) \rightarrow \text{Mortal}(x)).
    \]

- **Existential Quantifier (∃)**: Indicates that the statement applies to at least one entity.

  - **Example**: There exists a person who loves Mary can be written as
    \[
    \exists x (\text{Person}(x) \land \text{Loves}(x, \text{Mary})).
    \]

# Logical Semantics and Truth Conditions

- **Truth Conditions**: Logical semantics can be used to define when a statement is true or false.
- A sentence like `Loves(John, Mary)` is true if, in the world, John loves Mary.
- This is essential for building systems that can reason about the truth of statements or make inferences.

# What is Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)?

- **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)** is a process that identifies the roles of words in a sentence (who did what to whom).
  - It captures the relationships between the predicate (verb) and its arguments (subject, object, etc.).
  - SRL helps in understanding the meaning of sentences in tasks like machine translation, summarization, and question answering.

# Importance of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)

- **SRL enables machines to understand who is doing what to whom, when, and where.**

- **It abstracts away from surface syntax, focusing on the deeper semantic structure of sentences.**

- **SRL is widely used in NLP tasks like information extraction, machine translation, and textual entailment.**

# Key Concepts in SRL

- **Predicate**: The main verb or action in the sentence.
- **Arguments**: The participants involved in the action.
- **Semantic Roles**:
  - **Agent**: The doer of the action.
  - **Patient**: The entity affected by the action.
  - **Instrument**: The tool used to perform the action.
  - **Location**: Where the action occurs.

# Semantic Role Sets

- Different semantic role sets are used in SRL systems:
  - **PropBank:** Focuses on predicate-argument structures for verbs.
  - **FrameNet:** Uses a broader set of semantic roles based on frames and scenarios.
- These role sets help standardize the labeling of different roles in sentences.

# PropBank and FrameNet

- **PropBank**: Annotates predicates and their arguments based on verb-specific roles (e.g., 'Arg0', 'Arg1' for subject and object roles).
- **FrameNet**: Groups words into semantic frames that capture relationships between different participants in a scenario.
- Both frameworks are commonly used in SRL tasks to represent meaning in a structured way.

# SRL and Machine Learning

- Supervised learning is often used to train SRL models.
- These models learn to identify semantic roles by training on labeled data (e.g., PropBank annotations).
- Techniques include Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers.

# Evaluation Metrics for SRL

- **Precision**: Proportion of correctly identified roles out of all roles identified.
- **Recall**: Proportion of correctly identified roles out of all true roles.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

# Logical Semantics vs. SRL

- **Logical Semantics:** Focuses on truth conditions and logical structure of sentences.
- **Semantic Role Labeling:** Focuses on identifying the roles of participants in an action.
- **Both approaches contribute to understanding meaning, but they do so in different ways.**

# Applications of Logical Semantics and SRL

- **Logical Semantics**: Used in formal reasoning, query systems, and ontology mapping.
- **Semantic Role Labeling**: Used in information extraction, machine translation, and summarization.
