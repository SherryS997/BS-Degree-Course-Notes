# Stemming

**Stemming** refers to the process of slicing a word with the intention of removing affixes. Known as crude chopping of affixes.

Stemming is **problematic** in the linguistic perspective, since it sometimes produces words that are not in the language, **or else words that have a different meaning**.

# Examples of Stemming

- **Original Word** → **Stemmed Form**

  - "Caring" → "car"
  - "Studied" → "stud"
  - "Running" → "run"
  - "Happiness" → "happi"

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Stemming

- **Advantages of Stemming**
  - Fast and simple to implement.
  - Reduces dimensionality of text data, making it easier to analyze.

- **Disadvantages of Stemming**

# Lemmatization

**Lemmatization** has the objective of reducing a word to its base form, also called **Lemma**, therefore grouping together different forms of the same word.

# Lemmatization

Lemmatization has the objective of reducing a word to its base form, also called Lemma, therefore grouping together different forms of the same word.

## Example:

- `am, are, is` > `be`
- `car, cars, car's, cars'` > `car`
- `the boy's cars are different colors` > `the boy car be different color`

Lemmatization and stemming are mutually exclusive, and the former is much more resource-intensive than the latter.

# How It Works?

- **Lemmatization** requires a detailed understanding of the word's part of speech (POS) and context to transform it into the correct lemma.
```

**Note**: The specific content details in the provided slides are brief and focus on the concept of lemmatization. The markdown format maintains the bullet points and headers for clarity.

# Comparison of Stemming and Lemmatization

| Feature   | Stemming                          | Lemmatization                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Approach** | Rule-based, chops off suffixes     | Dictionary-based, considers POS    |
| **Result**  | Stem (may not be a real word)     | Lemma (always a real word)         |
| **Speed**  | Faster, less computationally intensive | Slower, more computationally intensive |
| **Accuracy** | Less accurate, may distort meaning | More accurate, preserves meaning    |
| **Use Case** | Simple text processing            | Advanced text analysis and NLP tasks |
| **"Running"** | Stem: "runn"                      | Lemma: "run"                        |
| **"Studies"** | Stem: "studi"                     | Lemma: "study"                      |

# Practical Applications of Stemming

- **Search Engines:**
  - Reduces variations of words to their base form to improve search results.
  - For example, searching for "run" might also return "running" and "ran."

- **Text Mining:**
  - Simplifies words in a large dataset, making it easier to analyze patterns.

# Practical Applications of Lemmatization

- **Machine Translation:**
  - Ensures that words are translated accurately by maintaining their base form.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Improves the accuracy of text sentiment analysis by understanding the correct form of words.

- **Speech Recognition:**
  - Helps in identifying the correct form of spoken words to improve transcription accuracy.
