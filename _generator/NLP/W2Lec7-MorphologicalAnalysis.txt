# What is Morphology?

Two dominant views of Morphology:-

- Morphology is the study of
  - the mental system involved in word formation
  - words, their internal structure, and their formal relationships.

Its etymology is Greek:
- *morph-* means 'shape, form'
- *morphology* is the study of form or forms.
  The word 'morphologie' was first used by August Schleicher in 1859.

The earliest and the first morphological analysis of a human language:
- *Ashtadhyayi* by Panini.

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 10

# Concepts of Morphology

- **Null Hypothesis:** Morphological processing can be undesirable since every word in a language may be stored and accessed as and when required.

- Continuously new words are integrated while others are drifting out of use.

- However, in any human language
  - possible words are infinite in number!
  - actual and attested words are also unmanageably large in number.

- Hence, it is necessary to formulate **Morphological rules or Word Formation Strategies** to permit us to recognize or produce new words.

## Slide 11 / 66

- **Native speakers create new words from the existing ones or borrow from other languages as and when necessary.**

- **The discovery of these mechanisms and the intuitive knowledge underlying this creativity is what is usually known as morphology.**

- **Speakers possess intuitive knowledge about:**
  - words are related to each other partially in the form and meaning

    e.g. walk, walks, walked, walking, walker, walkathon etc.
```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 12

```markdown
# Native Speaker's Linguistic Abilities

- **Native speaker’s ability to derive or relate the words in terms of their form and meaning:**
  - active
  - activity
  - activate
  - activator
  - activation

- **Alternatively native speaker’s ability to reject \*cat-en, \*cat-z, \*cat-iz, (for cats), walk \*walken; drive \*drived; read \*readed, \*readen; active \*activement, \*activance, and \*activant as illformed is because of the knowledge of morphology.**

# Morphology

There are two basic divisions in morphology:

1. **Inflectional Morphology** (conjugation/declension)
   - This branch of morphology deals with the rules governing word formation within a language through inflection. Inflectional morphology involves changes to words to express grammatical categories such as tense, number, case, and gender. Examples include adding "-s" to form the plural of nouns in English (e.g., "cats") or changing verb endings to indicate past tense (e.g., "walked").

2. **Lexical Morphology** (word formation)
   - Lexical morphology focuses on the creation of new words through processes such as derivation and compounding. This includes the formation of new words from existing word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. Examples include forming the adjective "happy" from the noun "happiness" or creating the verb "unhappy" by adding the prefix "un-" to "happy".

# Free Morpheme:
A morpheme that can stand alone, that is a complete word; an independent morpheme.

- Examples: **walk**, **book**, **but**, **of** and etc.,

# Lexical Morpheme:
A morpheme that denotes the content words. They receive inflection.

- Open class categories such as **Nouns**, **Verbs** and **Adjectives**.
- Closed class categories such as **Pronouns**, **Number words** and **Nouns of space and time (NST)**.

# Functional Morpheme:
A morpheme that denotes the functional words. They do NOT receive inflection and are indeclinables or avyayas.

- Categories such as **Prepositions/Postpositions**, **Conjunctions**, **Interjections**, **Adverbs**, **Demonstratives**, **Intensifiers**, **Quotatives** etc.,

# Bound Morpheme
A morpheme that cannot stand alone, but must be attached to something else.

Examples:
- **-ed** 'past tense marker',
- **-s** 'plural marker',
- **-er** 'comparative maker'

# Inflectional Morpheme
Creates new forms of the same word with the addition of grammatical properties; the basic meaning (and the category) of the word is the same.

## Inflection in English:
### a. With nouns:
- book
- books
- book's
- books'

### b. With verbs:
- ride
- rides
- rode
- ridden
- riding

### c. With adjectives:
- old
- older
- oldest

### d. With numbers:
- seven
- seventh

# Affix

## Affixes:
An affix is a bound morpheme that is attached to stem to form a word.

### Affixes may be derivational
eg. -ish boy = boy-ish
-less care = care-less

### Affixes may be inflectional
eg. -s book = book-s
-ed work = work-ed

# Concatenative phenomena

## Prefix

**Definition:**

a bound morpheme added before a root/stem, or at the beginning of a word.

**Example:**

- un- as in undo

**Schema:**

prefix-root/stem

## Suffix

**Definition:**

a bound morpheme added after a stem, or at the end of a word.

**Example:**

- ing as in looking

**Schema:**

root/stem-suffix

# Non-concatenative phenomena

## Infix:

an affix added within a single morpheme, i.e appears within a stem.

eg. Philippines
bili 'buy' is a root
bumili 'bought' is an example for infix and -um- is a past tense marker.

## Circumfix:

A circumfix is an affix made up of two separate parts which surround and attach to a root or stem.

In Dutch, ge\_\_te is a plural suffix
berg 'mountain'  gebergte 'mountains'
vogel 'bird'  gevogelte 'birds'
raam 'frame'  geraamte 'frames'

# Allomorph

- The physical variation of a morpheme is called as allomorphs.
- A morpheme may display allomorphy, i.e. have more than one form.
- The allomorphs are physically different forms, but they indicate same meaning of a morpheme.

## Types of allomorph:

- **Phonologically Conditioned Allomorph**
- **Lexically Conditioned Allomorph**
- **Suppletive**

# Allomorph

## Phonologically Conditioned Allomorph

The variants in the pronunciation of the plural are phonologically conditioned allomorphs, because the choice depends only on the phonological characteristics of the element to which it attaches.

The English plural morpheme has three allomorphs:
- /s/ bits, tips, tacks,
- /z/ dogs, slabs
- /ɪz/ ladies, bodies

Here, [s],[z],[ɪz] are the allomorphs the morpheme let’s say /z/.

# Allomorph

## Lexically Conditioned Allomorph

When the choice of allomorphs are unpredictable from the knowledge of language’s Morphology and Phonology, they are lexically conditioned allomorphs. Since there is no pattern, there is no rule: the information is just in the lexicon.

**English:**

- two oxen *two oxes *two ox
- two deer *two deers *two deeren
- man men
- child children
- sheep sheep

# Allomorph

Suppletion is an extreme form of allomorph in which two completely different roots realize the same morpheme.

# Morphological Typology

- Languages can be classified into groups based on a number of different linguistic criteria.
- One such way to categorize languages is by the type and extent of **morphology** that they use.
- Some languages string many morphemes together to form words. They are called **synthetic languages**.
- While some other languages tend to realize most words as independent or mono-morphemic segments. They are called as **analytic languages**.
- This typology should be seen not as a strict dichotomy between analytic and synthetic, but rather as a scale on which languages can be placed depending on the degree to which they exhibit that type of morphology.

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 31

# Morphological Typology

Morphological typology is the basis for the broad classification of Languages of the world into four major Morphological types:

- **Isolating Languages (analytic)**:
  - each word tends to consist of a single, independent morpheme
  - there are no bound forms i.e. affixes
  - grammatical markers, for features like tense and case, are generally realized as unattached (free) morphemes.
  - morpheme = word
  - grammatical changes are indicated by word order

# Analytical Languages

Analytical languages are most common in Southeast Asia (Chinese, Vietnamese), but some such languages are also found among the Austronesian languages (Fijian, Tongan) and some Niger-Congo languages (Gbe, Yoruba).

## Example from Vietnamese:

- **Text:** `no se khong doc sach he FUT NEG read book 'he will not read book'`

## Example from Chinese:

- **Text:** `Ta ba shu mai le He NOM book buy Asp 'He bought the book.'`

# Morphological Typology

## Agglutinative Languages (synthetic):

- all bound forms are affixes
- they are added to a stem like beads on a string
- every affix represents different morphological feature
- each morpheme represents only one grammatical meaning
- morpheme < word
- word order is slightly less important than it was in analytic languages.
- eg. Dravidian, Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian etc.

# Morphological Typology

- **Inflectional Languages (fusional):**
  - distinct features are merged into a single bound form (portmanteau morph)
  - morpheme boundaries are difficult to identify
  - every suffix has several grammatical functions

The classical Indo-European languages like Sanskrit, Greek, Latin etc. are examples of flexional languages where in the inflectional morphemes are said to be “fused” together.

### Example from Ancient Greek:

| Greek Word  | Gloss                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| λυ-δ       | `1S:PRES:ACT:IND` (I am releasing)            |
| λυ-δμαι    | `1S:PRES:ACT:SBJV` (I should release)         |

# Item and Arrangement

## 1. Item and Arrangement (IA)

- **Morpheme Based Morphology**
- Conceived as object oriented concatenation.
- No notion of basic allomorphs
- Word-forms are analyzed as sequences of concatenated morphemes
- Cut and paste method
- *anti-dis-establish-ment-ar-ian-ism* is analyzed as *establish*, a root morpheme and the rest as bound derivational morphemes.

Example:

(i) -s plural is pronounced [s] after voiceless obstruent
e.g.
book ⇒ books [s]
cat ⇒ cats [s]

(ii) -s plural is pronounced [z] after voiced sounds
e.g.
bag ⇒ bags [z]
lamb ⇒ lambs [z]

(iii) -s plural is pronounced [ɪz] after sibilant consonants such as [s], [z], [ʃ], [s], [ts], [d3]
e.g.
bus ⇒ buses [ɪz]
watch ⇒ watches [ɪz]
```

# Item and Arrangement

- In this approach, the relationship between allomorphs like [s], [z], [iz], [ren], [en] and [0] are missed out.
- Furthermore it assumes that words are always composed of discrete sequences of morphemes.
- However, in a number of languages linear sequencing of morphemes is not the favoured method of deriving words.
- Therefore, a morpheme-based model quickly leads to complications when one tries to analyze many forms of allomorphy.
- Analyzing words as sequences of morphemes simply ignores the intuition that words are related to each other in more than one aspect i.e. formally and semantically.

# Item and Arrangement

For example, the word cats can be easily sliced into cat and the plural morpheme -s.

But a similar analysis of the words geese, men, feet etc. into their corresponding roots and plural morphemes runs into difficulty.

# Item and Process

## 2. Item and Process

- **Lexeme based Morphology**
- **Applying rules to form new words**
- **Notion of allomorphs**
- **An inflectional rule takes a lexeme, changes it as is required by the rule, and outputs a word-form.**
- **Bypasses the difficulties inherent in the Item-and-Arrangement approach.**

# Item and Process

- There is a concept of allomorph in IP.
- Let’s take again English plural formation.
- If /z/ is taken as basic morpheme, it has allomorphs like [s], [z], [iz], [ren], [en] and [0].

  - Rule 1: /z/ → [s] / [-voiced]___#
  - Rule 2: /z/ → [z] / [+voiced]___#
  - Rule 3: /z/ → [iz] / [+sibilant]___#

- The problematic cases like men can start with man and apply the rules of plural formation which automatically massage the form into a well-formed word-form.
  - Rule 4: man + /z/ → men
  - Rule 5: child + /z/ → children

# Word and Paradigm

## 3. Word and Paradigm

- **Word based Morphology**
- **Paradigm as the central notion**
- **Good to tackle exceptions in a language**
- Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word-forms, or to generate word-forms from stems, word-based morphology makes generalizations that hold between various forms of inflectional paradigms.
- Words are treated as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules.
- The assumption is, a **morpho-syntactic Property (P)** is associated with the root/stem (X). Words (XP) are viewed as exponents of P.
- Each paradigm is different in their **morpho-phonemic / add-delete** processes.

# Typology Vs. Model

## Morphological Typology Vs. Model

The three models of morphology (IA, IP and WP) more or less match languages with different morphological types (agglutination (synthetic), inflectional (fusional) and incorporation (polysynthetic)).

- The **Item-and-Arrangement** approach fits very naturally with **agglutinative** languages;
- while the **Item-and-Process** and **Word-and-Paradigm** approaches usually address **flexional** languages;
- **Word-and Paradigm** approach fits very well to **incorporating** languages.

# Computational model: Finite State Technology

- [ ] Finite State Automata
- [ ] Finite State Transducers

**Finite State Automata (FSA)** is a abstract mathematical device which describes processes involving inputs and processing it. FSA may have several states and switches between them. Each state is crossed depending on the input symbol and performs the computational tasks associated with the input.

A Finite State Automaton is a machine composed of

- [ ] An input tape
- [ ] A finite number of states, with one initial and one or more accepting states
- [ ] Actions in terms of transitions from one state to the other, depending on the current state and the input

# Finite State Transducer:

- **FST** unlike **FSA** works on two tapes; input and output tape.
- FSAs can recognize a string but do not give the internal structures.
- But **FSTs** can recognize and able to provide the internal structure of any input.
- They read from one tape and write on another tape.
- So it is possible to turn **FST** to analyse and generate the forms.

# Morphological Analysis and Generation

- **Morphological analysis and generation: Inverse processes.**
- **Analysis** may involve **non-determinism**, since more than one analysis is possible.
- **Generation** is a **deterministic process**.
- In case a language allows spelling variation, to that extent, generation also involves non-determinism

# Conclusion

- MA & MG are indispensable modules for any NLP applications in Indian languages

- Understanding morpheme-phonemics and morpheme-syntax are required for WP model

- Not morphology:
  - Tokenization (before morphology)
  - Stemming and Lemmatization (instead of morphology)
  - POS tagging (after morphology)

- Selecting the appropriate morphological analysis is a challenging task which are done by other specific modules.
