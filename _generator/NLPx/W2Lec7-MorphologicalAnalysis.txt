### Content:
- **Definition and Overview of Morphology**:
  - Morphology is the branch of biology that deals with the form and structure of organisms and their parts.
  - It encompasses the study of the external form, internal structure, and development of diverse life forms.
  - Morphological studies include the analysis of shape, size, and arrangement of structures.

### Key Concepts:
- **External Morphology**:
  - Study of the outer form and structure of an organism.
  - Includes body shape, size, and the arrangement of external features such as limbs, appendages, and sensory organs.

- **Internal Morphology**:
  - Focuses on the internal structure of an organism.
  - Includes the study of organs, tissues, and cellular components.

- **Comparative Morphology**:
  - The comparison of the morphological features of different species.
  - Used to infer evolutionary relationships and phylogenetic trees.

### Importance:
- **Systematic Biology**:
  - Morphology plays a crucial role in the classification and identification of species.
  - Helps in understanding the evolutionary history and relationships among organisms.

- **Functional Morphology**:
  - The study of how the form and structure of an organism’s parts relate to their function.
  - Examples include the wings of birds for flight and the jaws of predators for capturing prey.

---

### Additional Details:
- **Applications**:
  - Used in medical diagnostics to identify diseases based on physical symptoms.
  - Utilized in paleontology to reconstruct extinct organisms based on fossil records.

### References and Further Reading:
- For detailed studies, refer to specialized textbooks and scientific journals on morphology.
- Additional resources include online databases and educational materials from institutions like IITM.

# What is Morphology?

Two dominant views of Morphology:-

- Morphology is the study of
  - the mental system involved in word formation
  - words, their internal structure, and their formal relationships.

Its etymology is Greek:
  - *morph-* means 'shape, form'
  - *morphology* is the study of form or forms.
The word 'morphologie' was first used by August Schleicher in 1859.

The earliest and the first morphological analysis of a human language:
  - *Ashtadhyayi* by Panini.

```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 10

```markdown
# Concepts of Morphology

- **Null Hypothesis:** Morphological processing can be undesirable since every word in a language may be stored and accessed as and when required.

- Continuously new words are integrated while others are drifting out of use.

- However, in any human language
  - possible words are infinite in number!
  - actual and attested words are also unmanageably large in number.

- Hence, it is necessary to formulate **Morphological rules** or **Word Formation Strategies** to permit us to recognize or produce new words.
```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 11

```markdown
# Morphology and Intuitive Knowledge

- Native speakers create new words from the existing ones or borrow from other languages as and when necessary.

- The discovery of these mechanisms and the intuitive knowledge underlying this creativity is what is usually known as morphology.

- Speakers possess intuitive knowledge about:
  - words are related to each other partially in the form and meaning

    ```plaintext
    e.g. walk, walks, walked, walking, walker, walkathon etc.

## Native Speaker's Ability

- **Native speaker’s ability to derive or relate the words in terms of their form and meaning:**
  - active
  - activity
  - activate
  - activator
  - activation

- **Alternatively native speaker’s ability to reject *cat-en, *cat-z, *cat-iz, (for cats), walk →*walken; drive→*driven; read →*readed, *readen; active → *activement, *activance, and *activant as illformed is because of the knowledge of morphology.**

# Two Basic Divisions in Morphology

There are two basic divisions in morphology:

1. **Inflectional Morphology (Conjugation/Declension)**
2. **Lexical Morphology (Word Formation)**

# Building Blocks of Morphology

## Morpheme

**Morpheme**: the smallest meaningful linguistic unit. Some morphemes are identical with words, but many morphemes are smaller than words.

### Morpheme ≤ Word

- **morphemes**
  - **free**
    - lexical (child, teach)
    - functional (and, the)
  - **bound**
    - derivational (re-, -ness)
    - inflectional (-'s, -ed)

```markdown
# Free Morpheme

A **free morpheme** is a morpheme that can stand alone, that is a complete word; an independent morpheme.

**Example**:
- *walk*, *book*, *but*, *of* and etc.,

# Lexical Morpheme

A **lexical morpheme** is a morpheme that denotes the content words. They **receive inflection**.

- **Open class categories**:
  - Nouns
  - Verbs
  - Adjectives

- **Closed class categories**:
  - Pronouns
  - Number words
  - Nouns of space and time (NST)

# Functional Morpheme

A **functional morpheme** is a morpheme that denotes the functional words. They **do NOT receive inflection** and are **indeclinables** or **avyayas**.

- **Categories**:
  - Prepositions/Postpositions
  - Conjunctions
  - Interjections
  - Adverbs
  - Demonstratives
  - Intensifiers
  - Quotatives etc.,

# Bound morpheme

**A morpheme that cannot stand alone, but must be attached to something else.**

Examples:
- **-ed** 'past tense marker',
- **-s** 'plural marker',
- **-er** 'comparative maker'

# Inflectional Morpheme

Creates new forms of the same word with the addition of grammatical properties; the basic meaning (and the category) of the word is the same.

## Inflection in English:

### a. with nouns:
- book, **books**, book's, books'

### b. with verbs:
- ride, **rides**, rode, **ridden**, **riding**

### c. with adjectives:
- old, **older**, **oldest**

### d. with numbers:
- seven, **seventh**

# Derivational Morpheme

**Derivational morpheme:** creates a new word with a different meaning that may belong to a different or to the same grammatical category.

- **RE** + **WRITE** = **rewrite** "write again", verb
- **WRITE** + **ER** = **writer** "one who writes", noun

## Derivation in English:

### a. Verb to Noun:
- **kill** ⇒ **killer**

### b. Noun to Verb:
- **glory** ⇒ **glorify**

### c. Adjective to Noun:
- **dark** ⇒ **darkness**

### d. Noun to Adjective:
- **person** ⇒ **personal**

### e. Adjective to Verb:
- **modern** ⇒ **modernize**

### f. Verb to Adjective:
- **walk** ⇒ **walkable**

### g. Adjective to Adverb:
- **great** ⇒ **greatly**

# Affix

## Affixes:

An affix is a bound morpheme that is attached to stem to form a word.

### Affixes may be derivational

e.g. -ish  boy = boy-ish

-less  care = care-less

### Affixes may be inflectional

e.g. -s  book = book-s

-ed  work = work-ed
```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 20

```markdown
# Concatenative phenomena

**Prefix:**

a bound morpheme added before a root/stem, or at the beginning of a word.
eg. un- as in undo

Schema: **prefix-root/stem**

**Suffix:**

a bound morpheme added after a stem, or at the end of a word.
eg. -ing as in looking

Schema: **root/stem-suffix**

![](attachment:BS-DS IITM (BSCS5002)) 20 / 66
```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 21

```markdown
# Non-concatenative phenomena

## Infix:

- an affix added within a single morpheme, i.e. appears within a stem.
  - e.g. Philippines
    - bili 'buy' is a root
    - bumili 'bought' is an example for infix and -um- is a past tense marker.

## Circumfix:

- A circumfix is an affix made up of two separate parts which surround and attach to a root or stem.

  In Dutch, ge\_\_te is a plural suffix
  - berg 'mountain' gebergte 'mountains'
  - vogel 'bird' gevogelte 'birds'
  - raam 'frame' geraamte 'frames'

# Allomorph

- The physical variation of a morpheme is called as allomorphs.
- A morpheme may display allomorphy, i.e. have more than one form.
- The allomorphs are physically different forms, but they indicate the same meaning of a morpheme.

## Types of allomorph:

- **Phonologically Conditioned Allomorph**
- **Lexically Conditioned Allomorph**
- **Suppletive**

# Allomorph

## Phonologically Conditioned Allomorph

The variants in the pronunciation of the plural are phonologically conditioned allomorphs, because the choice depends only on the phonological characteristics of the element to which it attaches.

The English plural morpheme has three allomorphs:

- /s/ bits, tips, tacks,
- /z/ dogs, slabs
- /ɪz/ ladies, bodies

Here, [s],[z],[ɪz] are the allomorphs the morpheme let’s say /z/.

# Allomorph

## Lexically Conditioned Allomorph

When the choice of allomorphs are unpredictable from the knowledge of language's Morphology and Phonology, they are lexically conditioned allomorphs. Since there is no pattern, there is no rule: the information is just in the lexicon.

### English:

- two oxen   *two oxes   *two ox
- two deer   *two deers   *two deeren
- man       men
- child     children
- sheep     sheep

# Allomorph

Suppletion is an extreme form of allomorph in which two completely different roots realize the same morpheme.

- one | first

# Morphological Typology

### Morphological Typology

Morphological typology is a branch of linguistics that studies the structure and formation of words in a language. It is concerned with the ways in which words are built from smaller meaningful units called morphemes. Morphological typologies are defined based on the relationship between the morphemes and the word forms in a language.

#### Types of Morphological Typologies

1. **Agglutinative Languages**
   - In agglutinative languages, each morpheme has a single, distinct function, and words can be long because they can consist of many morphemes.
   - Example: Turkish
     - **Morpheme Breakdown**: "kitaplarımızı" (our books)
       - **kitap** (book)
       - **lar** (plural)
       - **ı** (possessive 1st person plural)
       - **mızı** (accusative)

2. **Inflectional Languages**
   - In inflectional languages, words can change form based on grammatical categories (e.g., noun case, tense, number).
   - Example: Latin
     - **Morpheme Breakdown**: "amō" (I love) to "amābimus" (we shall love)
       - **amō** (present, 1st person singular)
       - **amābimus** (future, 1st person plural)

3. **Isolating Languages**
   - In isolating languages, words are monomorphemic, meaning each word represents a single morpheme.
   - Example: Chinese
     - **Example**: "爱" (love), "人" (person), "朋友" (friend)
       - Each character represents a morpheme and a single concept.

4. **Polysynthetic Languages**
   - In polysynthetic languages, words can consist of many morphemes, but typically fewer than in agglutinative languages.
   - Example: Inuktitut
     - **Example**: "tukiujuk" (someone who is waiting for you)
       - Multiple morphemes combined to form a complex word.

#### Morphological Processes

1. **Derivation**
   - The formation of new words by adding affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes).
   - Example: "happy" + "ness" -> "happiness"

2. **Compounding**
   - The formation of new words by combining two or more words.
   - Example: "black" + "board" -> "blackboard"

3. **Inflection**
   - The modification of words to express grammatical categories.
   - Example: "cat" -> "cats" (plural)

4. **Conversion**
   - The change in part of speech without any change in form.
   - Example: "press" (verb) -> "press" (noun)

# Morphological Typology

- Languages can be classified into groups based on a number of different linguistic criteria.
- One such way to categorize languages is by the type and extent of **morphology** that they use.
- Some languages string many morphemes together to form words. They are called **synthetic languages**.
- While some other languages tend to realize most words as independent or mono-morphemic segments. They are called as **analytic languages**.
- This typology should be seen not as a strict dichotomy between analytic and synthetic, but rather as a scale on which languages can be placed depending on the degree to which they exhibit that type of morphology.

# Morphological Typology

Morphological typology is the basis for the broad classification of languages of the world into four major Morphological types:

- **Isolating Languages (analytic):**
  - Each word tends to consist of a single, independent morpheme
  - There are no bound forms i.e. affixes
  - Grammatical markers, for features like tense and case, are generally realized as unattached (free) morphemes.
  - Morpheme = word
  - Grammatical changes are indicated by word order

# Analytical Languages in Various Regions

Analytical languages are most common in Southeast Asia (Chinese, Vietnamese), but some such languages are also found among the Austronesian languages (Fijian, Tongan) and some Niger-Congo languages (Gbe, Yoruba).

## Example from Vietnamese:

```vietnamese
no se khong doc sach
he FUT NEG read book
'he will not read book'
```

## Example from Chinese:

```chinese
Ta ba shu mai le
He NOM book buy Asp
'He bought the book.'
```

# Morphological Typology

## Agglutinative Languages (synthetic):

- **all bound forms are affixes**
- **they are added to a stem like beads on a string**
- **every affix represents different morphological feature**
- **each morpheme represents only one grammatical meaning**
- **morpheme < word**
- **word order is slightly less important than it was in analytic languages.**
- **e.g. Dravidian, Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian etc.**

# Morphological Typology

- **Inflectional Languages (fusional):**
  - distinct features are merged into a single bound form (portmanteau morph)
  - morpheme boundaries are difficult to identify
  - every suffix has several grammatical functions

The classical Indo-European languages like Sanskrit, Greek, Latin etc. are examples of flexional languages where in the inflectional morphemes are said to be "fused" together.

### Example from Ancient Greek:

| Greek Word | Gloss         |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| λύ-ο | 1S:PRES:ACT:IND (I am releasing) |
| λύ-ομαί | 1S:PRES:ACT:SBJV (I should release) |
| λύ-ομαί | 1S:PRES:PASS:IND (I am being released) |
| λύ-οματί | 3S:PRES:ACT:OPT (I might release) |
| λύ-εται | 3S:PRES:PASS:IND (He is being released) |

(Note: The exact translation and grammatical breakdown might need to be verified against a Greek dictionary and grammatical resources.)

# Incorporating Languages (polysynthetic):

- **all bound forms are affixes**
  - All bound forms in such languages are affixes, which are attached to the base of a word to form new words.

- **Inflections are incorporated into the word.**
  - Inflections, which are changes made to words to indicate grammatical categories such as tense, number, or case, are incorporated directly into the word itself.

- **ability to form words that are equivalent to whole sentences in other languages**
  - These languages have the capability to create words that convey the same meaning as entire sentences in other languages.

- **morphologically extremely complex**
  - The morphology of these languages is extremely complex, involving a high degree of word formation using affixes.

- **Generally, morphology is more important than context and syntax.**
  - In these languages, morphology plays a more critical role than context and syntax in determining the meaning and structure of sentences.

- **eg. Icelandic/Aleutian**
  - Examples of polysynthetic languages include Icelandic and Aleutian.

## Slide Content

### Morphological Model (No additional text content or details provided)

---

### Notes and Details (If available)
1. **Basic Concepts**:
   - **Hexadecimal**: Used for compact representation.
     - Example: `0xFF` represents a byte with all bits set to 1.
   - **Binary**: Fundamental binary operations.
     - AND: `0 & 0 = 0`, `0 & 1 = 0`, `1 & 0 = 0`, `1 & 1 = 1`
     - OR: `0 | 0 = 0`, `0 | 1 = 1`, `1 | 0 = 1`, `1 | 1 = 1`
     - XOR: `0 ^ 0 = 0`, `0 ^ 1 = 1`, `1 ^ 0 = 1`, `1 ^ 1 = 0`
     - NOT: `~0 = 1`, `~1 = 0`
   - **Bitwise Shifts**:
     - Left shift: `5 << 1` = `10`
     - Right shift: `10 >> 1` = `5`

2. **Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion**:
   - Example: `0xA3` in binary is `10100011`

3. **Binary Arithmetic**:
   - Example: `01101010 + 00011101 = 01111001`

4. **Masks and Bit Manipulation**:
   - Setting a bit: `0000 & 0001 = 0001`
   - Clearing a bit: `0001 & ~0001 = 0000`

# Morphological Modeling

Modelling speaker’s knowledge about words.

Morphologists propose three models (Hockett, 1954) describing morphological formations:

1. **Item and Arrangement (IA)**
2. **Item and Process (IP)**
3. **Word and Paradigm (WP)**

# Item and Arrangement

## 1. Item and Arrangement (IA)

- **Morpheme Based Morphology**
- Conceived as object oriented concatenation.
- No notion of basic allomorphs
- Word-forms are analyzed as sequences of concatenated morphemes
- Cut and paste method
- **anti-dis-establish-ment-ar-ian-ism** is analyzed as **establish**, a root morpheme and the rest as bound derivational morphemes.

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 43

```markdown
# Example:

## (i) -s plural is pronounced [s] after voiceless obstruent

e.g.

- book ➔ books [s]
- cat ➔ cats [s]

## (ii) -s plural is pronounced [z] after voiced sounds

e.g.

- bag ➔ bags [z]
- lamb ➔ lambs [z]

## (iii) -s plural is pronounced [iz] after sibilant consonants such as [s], [z], [ʃ], [s] , [ts], [dʒ], [ʒ]

e.g.

- bus ➔ buses [iz]
- watch ➔ watches [iz]

```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 44

```markdown
# Item and Arrangement

- In this approach, the relationship between allomorphs like [s], [z], [iz], [ren], [en] and [0] are missed out.

- Furthermore it assumes that words are always composed of discrete sequences of morphemes.

- However, in a number of languages linear sequencing of morphemes is not the favoured method of deriving words.

- Therefore, a morpheme-based model quickly leads to complications when one tries to analyze many forms of allomorphy.

- Analyzing words as sequences of morphemes simply ignores the intuition that words are related to each other in more than one aspect i.e. formally and semantically.

# Item and Arrangement

For example, the word *cats* can be easily sliced into *cat* and the plural morpheme *-s*.

But a similar analysis of the words *geese, men, feet* etc. into their corresponding roots and plural morphemes runs into difficulty.

# Item and Process

## 2. Item and Process

- **Lexeme based Morphology**
- **Applying rules to form new words**
- **Notion of allomorphs**
- **An inflectional rule takes a lexeme, changes it as is required by the rule, and outputs a word-form.**
- **Bypasses the difficulties inherent in the Item-and-Arrangement approach.**

```

# W2Lec7-MorphologicalAnalysis.pdf - Page 47

```markdown
# Item and Process

- There is a concept of allomorph in IP.
- Let’s take again English plural formation.
- If /z/ is taken as basic morpheme, it has allomorphs like [s], [z], [iz], [ren], [en] and [ə].

  - **Rule 1:** `/z/` → `[s]` / `[+voiced]`\_\_#_
  - **Rule 2:** `/z/` → `[z]` / `[+voiced]`\_\_#_
  - **Rule 3:** `/z/` → `[iz]` / `[+sibilant]`\_\_#_

- The problematic cases like men can start with man and apply the rules of plural formation which automatically massage the form into a well-formed word-form.
  - **Rule 4:** `man + /z/` → `men`
  - **Rule 5:** `child + /z/` → `children`

# Word and Paradigm

## 3. Word and Paradigm

- **Word based Morphology**
- **Paradigm as the central notion**
- **Good to tackle exceptions in a language**
- **Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word-forms, or to generate word-forms from stems, word-based morphology makes generalizations that hold between various forms of inflectional paradigms.**
- **Words are treated as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules.**
- **The assumption is, a morpho-syntactic Property (P) is associated with the root/stem (X). Words (XP) are viewed as exponents of P.**
- **Each paradigm is different in their morpho-phonemic/ add-delete processes.**

# Typology Vs. Model

## Morphological Typology Vs. Model

The three models of morphology (IA, IP and WP) more or less match languages with different morphological types (agglutination (synthetic), inflectional (fusional) and incorporation (polysynthetic)).

- The **Item-and-Arrangement** approach fits very naturally with **agglutinative languages**;

- while the **Item-and-Process** and **Word-and-Paradigm** approaches usually address **flexional languages**;

- **Word-and Paradigm** approach fits very well to **incorporating languages**.

## Finite State Automata (FSA)

**Finite State Automata (FSA)** is a abstract mathematical device which describes processes involving inputs and processing it. FSA may have several states and switches between them. Each state is crossed depending on the input symbol and performs the computational tasks associated with the input. A Finite State Automaton is a machine composed of

- An input tape
- A finite number of states, with one initial and one or more accepting states
- Actions in terms of transitions from one state to the other, depending on the current state and the input

### Morphological Analyzers & Generators

Morphological analysis and generation are essential processes in computational linguistics and natural language processing. These techniques are used to manipulate and analyze the structure of words, typically at the morphological level.

#### Morphological Analysis

Morphological analysis involves breaking down a word into its constituent morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language. This process helps in understanding the grammatical structure and the meaning of words.

- **Stemming**: The process of reducing a word to its base or root form.
  - Example: "running" -> "run"

- **Lemmatization**: The process of converting a word to its base or dictionary form.
  - Example: "better" -> "good"

#### Morphological Generation

Morphological generation involves creating new words by combining morphemes. This process is useful for generating derivational forms of words and understanding word formation rules.

- **Inflection**: The process of changing a word to indicate grammatical information such as tense, number, or case.
  - Example: "walk" -> "walks"

- **Derivation**: The process of forming new words by adding affixes to the base word.
  - Example: "happy" -> "happiness"

### Applications

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Morphological analysis and generation are crucial in NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
- **Machine Translation**: These techniques help in translating words accurately between different languages.
- **Spelling Correction**: Morphological rules can be used to suggest correct spellings and word completions.

### Algorithms and Tools

Several algorithms and tools are available for morphological analysis and generation, including:

- **Stemmers**: Tools that perform stemming, such as Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer.
- **Lemmatizers**: Tools that perform lemmatization, such as WordNet Lemmatizer.
- **Morphological Generators**: Tools that generate inflections and derivations using rule-based systems.

### Example

Consider the word "unhappiness":

- **Analysis**:
  - Base form: "happy"
  - Negation prefix: "un-"
  - Noun suffix: "-ness"

- **Generation**:
  - Combine the morphemes: "un-" + "happy" + "-ness" -> "unhappiness"

### Conclusion

Morphological analysis and generation are fundamental for understanding and manipulating the structure of words. These techniques are widely used in NLP and other language-related tasks, facilitating more accurate and efficient processing of natural language.

- **Generates wordforms from given root, lcat, gend, num, pers, cm/tam and other grammatical information.**
- **Used in Machine Translation, Speech synthesis, TTS and etc.**

**Input:** wordform **Output:** root + lcat + feature values

| Language | Input                                      | Output |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Tamil    | rt=ArYu, lcat=n, g=n, n=sg, p=3, c=dir, cm=0 | ArYu   |
| Tamil    | rt=ArYu, lcat=v, g=any, n=sg, p=2, tam=IMP  | ArYu   |
| Tamil    | rt=ArYu, lcat=num, g=n, n=sg, p=3, c=dir, cm=0| ArYu   |
| Tamil    | rt=avar, lcat=pn, g=fm, n=sg, p=3, c=obl, cm=E | avarE  |
| Tamil    | rt=avarE, lcat=n, g=n, n=sg, p=3, c=dir, cm=0| avarE  |

# Morphological Analysis and Generation: Inverse Processes

- **Morphological analysis and generation**: Inverse processes.
- **Analysis**: May involve non-determinism, since more than one analysis is possible.
- **Generation**: Is a deterministic process.
- **In case a language allows spelling variation, to that extent, generation also involves non-determinism**

# Conclusion

- **MA & MG are indispensable modules for any NLP applications in Indian languages**

- Understand morpho-phonemics and morpho-syntax are required for WP model

- **Not morphology:**
  - Tokenization (before morphology)
  - Stemming and Lemmatization (instead of morphology)
  - POS tagging (after morphology)

- Selecting the appropriate morphological analysis is a challenging task which are done by other specific modules.
