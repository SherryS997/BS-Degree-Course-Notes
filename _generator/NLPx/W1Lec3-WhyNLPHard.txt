# Why NLP is hard?

1. **Ambiguity at many levels:**

   - **Word senses:** *bank* (finance or river?)
   - **Part of speech:** *chair* (noun or verb?)
   - **Syntactic structure:** *I saw a man with a telescope*
   - **Quantifier scope:** *Every child loves some movie*
   - **Multiple:** *I saw her duck*

   => NLP algorithms model ambiguity, and choose the correct analysis in context

2. **Linguistic diversity**
```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 4

```markdown
# Linguistic Diversity: Semantics

Every language describes the world in a different way, for example, it depends on culture or historical conditions.

![Color Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

- Russian has relatively few names for colors; Japanese has hundreds
- Multiword expressions, e.g. it’s raining cats and dogs or wake up and metaphors, e.g. Love is a journey are very different across languages

**Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis:**
the language we speak both affects and reflects our view of the world

# Why NLP is hard?

## 1. Ambiguity at many levels:

- **Word senses**: bank (finance or river?)
- **Part of speech**: blue (noun or verb?)
- **Syntactic structure**: I saw a man with a telescope
- **Quantifier scope**: Every child loves some movie
- **Multiple**: I saw her duck

  → NLP algorithms model ambiguity, and choose the correct analysis in context

## 2. Linguistic diversity

- 6–7K languages in the world, > 14 language families
- Languages diverge across all levels of linguistic structure

  → no generic solution for a particular NLP task

- Most of the languages do not have sufficient resources to build statistical NLP models

# Low-resource languages

## Languages lacking large monolingual or parallel corpora and/or manually crafted linguistic resources sufficient for building statistical NLP applications
```

The text describes the concept of **low-resource languages**, which are languages that lack extensive monolingual or parallel corpora and/or manually crafted linguistic resources necessary for developing statistical natural language processing (NLP) applications. This classification is crucial in the field of computational linguistics and NLP, as it highlights the challenges in creating advanced language models and tools for languages with limited available data.

# 1. Ambiguity in Natural Language

- **Ambiguity**: A major challenge in NLP, where words, phrases or sentences can have multiple interpretations.

- **Impact on NLP**: Ambiguity makes it difficult for algorithms to correctly understand and process language.

- **Types of ambiguity**:
  - **Lexical Ambiguity**
    - Homonyms
    - Polysemy
  - **Syntactic Ambiguity**
    - Attachment
    - Coordination
  - **Semantic Ambiguity**
    - Quantifier Scope
    - Anaphoric
  - **Pragmatic Ambiguity**
    - Deictic
    - Speech Act
    - Irony/Sarcasm

```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 12

```markdown
# A. Lexical Ambiguity

**Lexical Ambiguity**: Occurs when a word has multiple meanings.

- **i. Homonyms**:
  - Words that sound alike or are spelled alike but have different meanings.
  - **English Example**: **Bark** (the sound a dog makes vs. the outer covering of a tree)

- **ii. Polysemy**:
  - A single word with multiple related meanings.
  - **English Example**: **Head** (the top part of a body vs. leader of an organization)

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 13

```markdown
# B. Syntactic Ambiguity

## Syntactic Ambiguity
Occurs when a sentence can be parsed in more than one way due to its structure.

- **Attachment**:
  - **Ambiguity** arises when it is unclear which part of the sentence a modifier (e.g., a prepositional phrase) is associated with.
  - **Example**: He saw the man with the telescope.
    - (Did he use a telescope to see the man or did he see a man who had a telescope?)

- **Coordination**:
  - **Ambiguity** occurs when it is unclear how conjunctions like "and" or "or" connect different parts of a sentence.
  - **Example**: Old men and women were admitted free.
    - (Were only old men admitted free or both old men and all women?)

![BSCS5002](BSCS5002)
```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 14

```markdown
# C. Semantic Ambiguity

**Semantic Ambiguity:** Occurs when a sentence or phrase can have multiple meanings due to the interpretation of words or phrases.

- **Quantifier Scope Ambiguity:**
  Ambiguity arises when it’s unclear how far a quantifier (like "all" or "some") applies within a sentence.

  - **Example:** All students read some books.
    (Does it mean each student reads the same books or different books?)

- **Anaphoric Ambiguity:**
  Ambiguity occurs when a pronoun or a referring expression can be linked to multiple possible antecedents.

  - **Example:** John told Peter he would win.
    (Is "he" referring to John or Peter?)
```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 15

```markdown
# D. Pragmatic Ambiguity

## Pragmatic Ambiguity

**Pragmatic Ambiguity:** Occurs when a sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways based on context, tone or conversational implications.

- **Deictic Ambiguity:**
  Ambiguity arises when it is unclear to who or what a deictic expression (like "this," "that," "here," "there") refers.

  - **Example:** I'll meet you there.
    (Where is "there"?)

- **Speech Act Ambiguity:**
  Ambiguity occurs when it is unclear what kind of speech act (e.g., request, statement, command) a sentence represents.

  - **Example:** Can you pass the salt?
    (Is this a question about ability or a polite request?)

```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 16

```markdown
# D. Pragmatic Ambiguity

- **Irony/Sarcasm**:
  - Ambiguity arises when the intended meaning is the opposite of the literal meaning.
  - **Example**: *Oh, great! Another meeting!*
    - (Is the speaker genuinely excited or are they being sarcastic?)

# 2. Challenges in Multilingual NLP

- Processing multiple languages poses unique challenges in NLP, especially in a multilingual country like India.
- Differences in grammar, syntax, word order, and vocabulary between languages make it difficult to develop unified models.

## Indian Context:
- India has 22 official languages (9 as per 8th schedule), each with distinct linguistic characteristics.
- Many Indian languages, like Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil, differ significantly from English and among themselves, making multilingual NLP particularly challenging.

# Challenges with Low-Resource Languages

- Many Indian languages have limited digital resources, making it difficult to train NLP models effectively.
- Lack of large annotated datasets and linguistic tools hinders the development of accurate NLP models for these languages.

## Example:

- Languages like Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, etc. despite having millions of speakers, are underrepresented in NLP resources compared to English or Hindi.
- This creates a disparity in the quality of NLP applications, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.

# 3. Language Variability Across Speakers

- Language varies significantly across different speakers based on a variety of factors.
- This variability can be observed in different **dialects**, **sociolects**, and **idiolects**.

```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 30

```markdown
# A. Dialectal Variations:

- Dialects are distinct forms of a language spoken by specific groups, often distinguished by geographical regions. Each dialect can have unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

- **Example:**
  - In American English, the word "truck" is commonly used, whereas in British (and Indian) English, the same vehicle is referred to as a "lorry".
  - The pronunciation of certain words, like "tomato" (toh-MAH-toh vs. to-MAY-to), also differs between regions.

# B. Sociolects:

- Sociolects refer to variations in language used by specific social groups, often influenced by factors such as class, education, or occupation. The way language is used can signal social identity and status.

- **Example:**
  - In formal settings, people might say, "Good morning, how are you?" while in informal contexts, they might simply say, "Hey, what's up?"
  - Professional jargon is another example of sociolect, where specific terms are used within particular industries (e.g., legal jargon, medical terminology).
```

# W1Lec3-WhyNLPHard.pdf - Page 32

```markdown
# C. Idiolects:

- An idiolect is the unique form of language used by an individual. This includes personal preferences in word choice, pronunciation, and sentence structure. It reflects a person’s background, experiences, and personality.

- **Example:**
  - One person might frequently use certain filler words like "you know" or "like," while another avoids them.
  - Some individuals may have unique phrases or expressions that are distinctively their own.

# Why NLP is hard?

- **Ambiguity**: Words and sentences can have multiple meanings depending on context.
  - Example: "I saw the man with the telescope."

- **Context and Semantics**: Understanding the context and meaning behind words and sentences requires deep comprehension.
  - Example: Sarcasm and irony can be difficult for machines to detect.

- **Variety of Languages**: Each language has its own rules, syntax and nuances.
  - NLP models need to be adaptable to multiple languages and dialects.

# Why NLP is hard?

- **Evolution of Language**:
  - Language is constantly changing with new slang, idioms and phrases emerging.
  - Keeping up with these changes is challenging for NLP systems.

- **Data Quality and Quantity**:
  - High-quality, annotated data is necessary for training NLP models, but it is often scarce and expensive to obtain.
  - Large datasets are required for effective machine learning, but these can be difficult to compile.

- **Computational Complexity**:
  - Advanced NLP models require significant computational resources for training and inference.
  - Deep learning models, such as transformers, are computationally intensive.

- **Cultural and Ethical Considerations**:
  - NLP systems must be designed to avoid biases and respect cultural differences.
  - Ensuring fairness and reducing biases in NLP models is a significant challenge.
