# 1. Phonological Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The phonological level in NLP focuses on the processing of sounds in natural language, including their organization and patterns.

## Significance in NLP:

- Essential for applications like speech recognition and text-to-speech systems.
- Helps in understanding pronunciation, accent variations, and phonetic transcription.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 6

```markdown
# 1. Phonological Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Phonemes**: The smallest units of sound that distinguish meaning.

- **Phonetic Transcription**: Representing sounds using phonetic symbols (e.g., IPA).

- **Prosody**: The rhythm, stress and intonation patterns of speech that convey meaning beyond the words themselves.

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 7

```markdown
# 1. Phonological Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Speech Recognition**: Identifying spoken words by analyzing phonemes. For example, recognizing "cat" vs. "bat" based on initial phoneme differentiation.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generating spoken language from text while considering prosody for natural-sounding speech. For example, varying intonation in questions vs. statements.
- **Accent Recognition**: Differentiating between various accents (e.g., American vs. British English) by analyzing phonetic patterns.
```

# 2. Morphological Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The morphological level in NLP involves the study of the structure and formation of words, including their internal components.

## Significance in NLP:

- Crucial for tasks such as morphological analysis, lemmatization and stemming and part-of-speech tagging.
- Helps in understanding word forms, variations and their meanings.

# 2. Morphological Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Morphemes**: The smallest meaningful units of language (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, roots).

- **Inflection**: Modifications of words to express different grammatical categories (e.g., tense, number).

- **Derivation**: The process of creating new words by adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., "happy" -> "unhappy").

# 2. Morphological Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Morphological Analysis**: Analyzing the structure of words (prefixes, suffixes).

- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form. For instance, "better" is lemmatized to "good."

- **Stemming**: Cutting words to their root forms. For example, "running," "runner," and "ran" may all stem to "run."

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical category of words based on their morphology. For example, "running" can be tagged as a verb or noun depending on context.

# 3. Lexical Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Tokenization:** The process of breaking text into individual words or tokens.

- **Lexical Semantics:** The study of word meanings, relationships and nuances (synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms).

- **Vocabulary:** The set of words available in a language or a specific domain.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 13

```markdown
# 3. Lexical Level in NLP

  ```plaintext
  [The, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog]
  ```

- **Lexical Semantics**: Understanding that the word _"bank"_ can mean a financial institution or the side of a river based on context.

- **Synonym Detection**: Identifying that _"happy"_ and _"joyful"_ convey similar meanings in sentiment analysis tasks.

# 4. Syntactic Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Parsing**: The process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.
- **Constituency Parsing**: Identifying phrases within sentences based on hierarchical structure.
- **Dependency Parsing**: Establishing relationships between words in a sentence and their dependencies.

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 16

```markdown
# 4. Syntactic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Parsing**: For the sentence "The cat sat on the mat.", parsing can show:
  ```
  [NP The cat] [VP sat [PP on [NP the mat]]]
  ```

- **Dependency Parsing**: In the sentence "She loves him.", dependencies can be visualized as:
  ```
  loves ← She
  loves → him
  ```

- **Grammar Rules**: Syntax can be governed by rules such as:
  - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure in English.
  - Differences in structure like Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) in Hindi.

# 5. Semantic Level in NLP

## Definition:

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 18

```markdown
# 5. Semantic Level in NLP

**Key Components:**

- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** Determining which meaning of a word is used in context.

- **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** Identifying the roles that words play in a sentence (e.g., agent, action, object).

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Recognizing and classifying entities in text (e.g., names, dates, locations).
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 19

```markdown
# 5. Semantic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Word Sense Disambiguation**: The word "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river and WSD helps determine the correct meaning based on context (e.g., "He went to the bank to deposit money." vs. "The river bank was eroded.").

- **Semantic Role Labeling**: In the sentence "John gave Mary a book", SRL identifies:
  - **Agent**: John
  - **Recipient**: Mary
  - **Theme**: a book

- **Named Entity Recognition**: In the sentence "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for dollar 1 billion", NER identifies:
  - **Organization**: Apple
  - **Location**: U.K.
  - **Monetary Value**: dollar 1 billion

# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The discourse level in NLP deals with how sentences relate to one another in larger contexts, focusing on coherence and cohesion in language.

## Significance in NLP:

- Essential for understanding context beyond individual sentences.
- Important for tasks such as text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue systems.

![BS-DS IITM (BSCS5002)](attachment:20/27)
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 21

```markdown
# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Coherence**: The logical flow of ideas in a text, ensuring that sentences connect meaningfully.

- **Cohesion**: The grammatical and lexical linking within a text that helps maintain the flow.

- **Anaphora Resolution**: Identifying which words refer back to others (e.g., resolving pronouns to their antecedents).
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 22

```markdown
# 6. Discourse Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Coherence**: In the text *"She went to the bakery. She bought a loaf of bread."* the ideas are coherent as the second sentence logically follows the first.

- **Cohesion**: The use of linking words such as *"however," "therefore,"* and *"moreover"* helps create cohesion between sentences.

- **Anaphora Resolution**: In the sentences *"John loves his dog. It follows him everywhere."* resolving *"it"* refers to *"his dog"*.
```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 23

```markdown
# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Definition:

- The pragmatic level in NLP focuses on how context influences the interpretation of meaning in communication, considering the speaker's intent and the situational context.

## Significance in NLP:

- Essential for understanding implied meanings, sarcasm and conversational dynamics.
- Important for tasks such as dialogue systems, sentiment analysis and context-aware machine translation.

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 24

```markdown
# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Key Components:

- **Speech Acts:** Actions performed via utterances (e.g., requests, promises, assertions).
- **Deixis:** Words and phrases (like pronouns and demonstratives) that require contextual information to convey meaning (e.g., "here," "you").
- **Contextual Understanding:** The ability to interpret meaning based on situational context and background knowledge.

```

# W1Lec4-Levels-Fundamentals.pdf - Page 25

```markdown
# 7. Pragmatic Level in NLP

## Examples in NLP:

- **Speech Acts**: The phrase "Can you pass the salt?" is a request, not just a question about capability.

- **Deixis**: In the sentence "I will meet you here tomorrow," the interpretation of "here" and "tomorrow" depends on the speaker's location and the current day.

- **Contextual Understanding**: In a conversation where one person says, "It’s cold in here," they may be implying a request to close a window rather than just stating a fact.
