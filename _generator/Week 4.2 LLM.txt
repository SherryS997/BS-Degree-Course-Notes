## Introduction

In this module, we will delve into the concept of Masked Language Modelling (MLM), a crucial technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to enhance language models.

### What is Masked Language Modelling?

Masked Language Modelling is a self-supervised learning technique where some of the tokens in the input text are masked and the model is trained to predict these masked tokens. This helps the model to understand the context and relationships between words in the text.

### Steps in Masked Language Modelling

1. **Masking Tokens**: Randomly select tokens from the input sentence and replace them with a mask token.
2. **Input to Model**: The masked sentence is fed into the language model.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts the masked tokens based on the context provided by the surrounding words.
4. **Loss Calculation**: The prediction is compared with the actual tokens, and the loss is computed.
5. **Optimization**: The model parameters are updated to minimize the loss, improving its ability to predict masked tokens accurately.

### Applications of Masked Language Modelling

- **Pre-training Language Models**: MLM is widely used to pre-train language models, which can then be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as translation, question answering, and text classification.
- **Improving Contextual Understanding**: By predicting masked tokens, the model learns to understand the context and relationships between words, making it more effective in understanding and generating human-like text.

### Example of Masked Language Modelling

Consider the sentence: "The cat sat on the mat."

1. **Original Sentence**: "The cat sat on the mat."
2. **Masking Tokens**: "The [MASK] sat on the [MASK]."
3. **Model Prediction**: "The **cat** sat on the **mat**."

The model correctly predicts the masked tokens based on the context.

### Conclusion

Masked Language Modelling is a powerful technique that enables language models to understand and generate contextually relevant text. By predicting masked tokens, models can learn the intricacies of language, improving their performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.

## We can use the encoder part of the transformer

Now, the problem is cast as

$$
P(y_i | x_1, x_i = [mask], \ldots, x_T) = ?
$$

It is assumed that the predicted tokens are independent of each other

We need to find out ways to mask the words in the input text.

### Objective

- **Can we MASK the attention weights of the words to be masked as in CLM?**

### Task

# Masked Language Model (MLM) Explanation

## Mask Representation

```plaintext
Mask = [
  -∞ 0 0 -∞ 0
  -∞ 0 0 -∞ 0
  -∞ 0 0 -∞ 0
  -∞ 0 0 -∞ 0
  -∞ 0 0 -∞ 0
]
```

## Explanation

### Why Use Masks?

Because we want the model to learn (attend to) what the blanks are.

We can think of the **(mask)** token as noise that corrupts the original input text.

Then the model is tasked to recover the original token.

This is similar to denoising objective of Auto Encoders.

For this reason, MLM is also called as pre-training denoising objective.

## Masked Language Model (MLM) Process

![MLM Process](image_url)

### Steps:

1. **MatMul: Q^T K**
   - Perform matrix multiplication between \( Q \) and \( K \) transposed.

2. **Scale: 1 / sqrt(d_k)**
   - Apply scaling factor \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}} \).

3. **Mask**
   - Apply the mask to the scaled matrix multiplication result.

4. **Softmax**
   - Apply softmax to the masked result.

5. **MatMul**
   - Perform matrix multiplication with the resulting vector \( V \).

This process helps the model to focus on understanding the context and relationships between words in the presence of masked tokens, enhancing its ability to learn meaningful representations.

# Using Special Tokens

## Self-Attention

![Self-Attention Diagram](image_url)

### Key Components:
- **k_i**: Key vectors
- **v_i**: Value vectors
- **q_i**: Query vectors
- **[mask]**: Mask token
- **W_t**: Transformer weights

### Example:
- **k_1**: [0.3, 0.2]
- **v_1**: [0.1, 0.5]
- **q_1**: [-0.1, 0.25]

- **k_5**: [0.01, 0.89]
- **v_5**: [0, 0.4]
- **q_5**: [0.02, 0.7]

### Process:
1. **Mask Token**: Use [mask] token for the words to be masked.
2. **Special Token**: Add [mask] as a special token in the vocabulary and get an embedding for it.
3. **Transformers**: Apply transformer weights (W_t).

A simple approach is to use **[mask]** token for the words to be masked.

Add **[mask]** as a special token in the vocabulary and get an embedding for it.

# Masked Language Model Loss Functions

## Loss Formulation

The overall loss function for a masked language model is given by:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|} \sum_{\hat{y_i} \in \mathcal{M}} -\log(\hat{y_i})
\]

This combines individual losses for masked predictions.

### Individual Losses

The individual losses for specific masked tokens are given by:

\[
\mathcal{L}_1 = -\log(\hat{y_1})
\]

\[
\mathcal{L}_2 = -\log(\hat{y_4})
\]

## Model Architecture

### Components

1. **Self-Attention**
2. **Feed Forward Network**

### Input Sequence

- Words are input to the model with some words masked (indicated by `[mask]`).
- The model processes the input through the self-attention mechanism and then the feed-forward network.

![Model Architecture Diagram](input_image.png) 

## Masking Strategy

### Masking Percentage

- **Typical Masking**: 15% of words in the input sequence are masked.
- **High Masking**: A very high masking percentage can result in a severe loss of context information, impeding the model's ability to learn good representations.
- **Low Masking**: Very little masking takes a long time for convergence as the gradient values are relatively small, making training inefficient.

### Trade-offs

The balance between masking percentage, model size, masking scheme, and optimization algorithm can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and constraints of the model. For more details, refer to the paper "Should you mask 15% in MLM?" to know more about optimizing these parameters.

### Masked Word Sampling
- The masked words (15%) in an input sequence are sampled uniformly.
- Of these:
  - 80% are replaced with **[mask]** token.
  - 10% are replaced with random words.
  - 10% are retained as is. (Why?)

### Special [mask] Token
- The special mask token won't be a part of the dataset while adapting for downstream tasks.

### Pre-training Objective of MLM
- Is pre-training objective of MLM sufficient for downstream tasks like Question-Answering where interaction between sentences is important?

# Diagram and Scientific Text Description

## Overview

This diagram illustrates a multi-layered neural network architecture with attention mechanisms, used for processing and predicting sequence data. The various components and their interactions are detailed below.

## Components

### Input Sequence

- **Input Tokens**: The input tokens are elements of the input sequence, such as `[CLS]`, `[mask]`, `enjoyed`, `the`, `[mask]`, `transformers`, `[SEP]`, `The`, `[mask]`, `were`, `amazing`.

### Encoder Layers

- The input sequence is passed through multiple **Encoder Layers**, each consisting of several sub-layers, typically including multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.

### Attention Mechanism

- **Attention Weights**: All elements of the input sequence are associated with attention weights \( W_v \) that help in focusing on specific parts of the input sequence.
- **Weight Multiplication**: The attention weights are multiplied by the input tokens to generate attention-weighted representations.

### Loss Functions

- **Loss Calculations**: The network uses different loss functions to measure the discrepancy between the predicted and actual outputs:
  - \(\mathcal{L}_{cls} = \log(\hat{y})\): Classification loss.
  - \(\mathcal{L}_1 = \log(\hat{y}_1)\): Loss for the first token.
  - \(\mathcal{L}_2 = -\log(y_4)\): Negative log-loss for the fourth token.
  - \(\mathcal{L}_3 = \log(\hat{y}_8)\): Loss for the eighth token.
  - \(\mathcal{L}_{cls} = \log(\hat{y}_i)\): Another classification loss.

### Objective Function

- **Objective Minimization**: The overall objective function to be minimized is given by:
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{y_i \in M} - \log(\hat{y}_i) - \mathcal{L}_{cls}
  \]

## Diagram Breakdown

### Input Sequence

The tokens of the input sequence are represented at the bottom-most layer, with special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[mask]`, and `[SEP]` included to facilitate processing.

### Encoder Layers

Four encoder layers are depicted, each illustrating the processing stages of the input tokens.

### Attention Mechanism

Above each encoder layer, attention weights \( W_v \) are applied to the input tokens. This is depicted by small blocks interacting with the input tokens.

### Loss Calculations

Losses are calculated for specific tokens and combined to form the final objective function. These are shown at the top of their respective tokens.

### Summary

The entire process is aimed at minimizing the objective function using backpropagation and gradient descent, ensuring the network learns to predict the correct output sequences.

**Note:**
- Take a sentence of length less than 512 and feed it as an input to BERT (with appropriate padding if required).

Take the final hidden representation (output of the last encoder) as a feature vector for the entire sentence.
- This representation is superior to merely concatenating representations (say from word2vec) of individual words.

### Classification Head Instructions

- **Add a classification head [again it could be any suitable ML model]**

- **Initialize the parameters of the classification head randomly.**

- **Now, train the entire model including the parameters of the pre-trained BERT for the new dataset.**

- **Note, however, that we do not mask words in the input sequence [the reason why we replaced 10% of masked words by random words during pre-training]**

- **It is observed that the model used in the classification head converges quickly with a less number of labelled training samples than the feature-based approach**

## Pretraining

### Model Architecture

1. **Bidirectional Transformer Encoder**
   - This forms the core of the pretraining model.
   - Inputs include:
     - `[CLS]` token
     - Masked Sentence A
     - `[SEP]` token
     - Masked Sentence B
     - `[PAD]` token (padding)

2. **Weights**
   - \( W_e \): Embedding weight matrix
   - \( W_a \): Attention weight matrix
   - \( W_f \): Final output weight matrix

3. **Process Flow**
   - Inputs are fed into the Bidirectional Transformer Encoder.
   - The encoder processes the input tokens.
   - Outputs are generated through the weight matrices \( W_e \), \( W_a \), and \( W_f \).

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `[CLS]`: Classification token.
  - Masked Sentence A: sentence A with masked tokens.
  - `[SEP]`: Separator token.
  - Masked Sentence B: sentence B with masked tokens.
  - `[PAD]`: Padding token (used to handle variable-length sequences).

- **Outputs**:
  - These are derived through various weight matrices applied to the processed input tokens.

### Visual Representation
![Pretraining Process](image-placeholder-url)

### Summary
The pretraining phase involves using unlabeled data from BookCorpus and Wikipedia to train a Bidirectional Transformer Encoder. Masking certain tokens and using special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, and `[PAD]` are essential for the pretraining process, which helps in learning meaningful representations of the input text.

# Extractive Question-Answering

Let $S$ denotes a start vector of size of $h_i$

the probability that $i-th$ word in the paragraph being the start token is

\[
s_i = \frac{\exp(S \cdot h_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{25} \exp(S \cdot h_j)}
\]

Let $E$ denotes an end vector of size of $h_i$

the probability that $i-th$ word in the paragraph being the end token is

\[
e_i = \frac{\exp(E \cdot h_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{25} \exp(E \cdot h_j)}

It is possible that the end token index might be lesser than the start token index. In that case, return an empty string.

## Example Illustration

- Tokens: `e_7`, `s_9`
- Indices: `j = 7`, `i = 9`

### Conditions

- **Condition 1**: If the end token index `j` is less than the start token index `i` (`j < i`)

  - **Action**: Return an empty string (implies that the answer is not in the paragraph)

### Explanation

The example shows that the token `e_7` is at index 7 and the token `s_9` is at index 9. Given that `j < i`, the condition is satisfied.

```plaintext
j = 7
i = 9
```
