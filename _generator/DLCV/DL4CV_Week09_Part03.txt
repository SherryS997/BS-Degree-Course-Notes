**Question:**
Where is the kid sitting?

**Submit**

**Image Description:**
In the image, a young child is sitting in a bathroom sink. The child is holding what appears to be an electronic device, possibly a toy, and is looking directly at the camera. The background includes standard bathroom elements such as a faucet, towels, and toiletries.

---

**Notes:**
- The image focuses on a child in a domestic setting, specifically a bathroom.
- The child is seated in an unconventional location, which is a bathroom sink.
- The question prompts an understanding of the visual context and everyday environments.
- The interactive element of "Submit" suggests a user interface for inputting answers.

  - Input: Image
  - Convolution Layer + Non-Linearity
  - Pooling Layer
  - Convolution Layer + Non-Linearity
  - Pooling Layer
  - Fully-Connected MLP
  - Output: 4096 output units from the last hidden layer (VGGNet, Normalized)

- **Language Feature Extraction**
  - Input: Question "How many horses are in this image?"
  - 2 × 2 × 512 LSTM Units
  - Sequence of LSTM layers

### Fusion and Prediction

- **Fusion of Features**
  - Image features (1024 dimensions)
  - Language features (1024 dimensions)
  - Point-wise Multiplication of the two feature vectors

- **Prediction Layers**
  - Fully-Connected Layer (1024 dimensions)
  - Fully-Connected Layer (1000 dimensions)

The stacked attention network first focuses on all referred concepts, e.g., *bicycle, basket* and objects in the basket (*dogs*) in the first attention layer and then further narrows down the focus in the second layer and finds out the answer "dog".

### Question Segmentation
- `What color`
- `color`
- `the`
- `stop light`
- `light`
- `...`

### Image Segmentation
- `color stop light lit`
- `the stop light`
- `stop`

### Co-Attention Mechanism
- Image co-attention maps visualize the attention distribution.
  - `color stop light lit`

### Question: What color on the stop light is lit up?

![Question Breakdown](image-url)

- **Word level embeddings:**
  - "What"
  - "color"
  - "on"
  - "the"
  - "stop"
  - "light"
  - "-"
  - "-"
  - "lit"
  - "up"

- **Phrase level embeddings:**
  - "What color"
  - "color on"
  - "on the"
  - "the stop"
  - "stop light"
  - "light -"
  - "- lit"
  - "lit up"

- **Question level embeddings:**
  - "What color on the stop light is lit up?"

### Co-Attention Process

1. **Word level embeddings** are matched with regions of the image.
2. **Phrase level embeddings** align with parts of the image.
3. **Question level embeddings** align with the overall image context.
