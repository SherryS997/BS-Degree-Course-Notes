2. **Encoder:**
   - Encodes the input into a **Context Vector** (Fixed Length).
   
3. **Decoder:**
   - Utilizes the context vector to produce the **Output Text**.

**Diagram Description:**
- The input is processed through an encoder which compresses it into a fixed-length context vector.
- This vector is then fed into the decoder to generate the output text.

### Notes:
- The context vector serves as a summary or representation of the input data.
- The decoder interprets this vector to produce meaningful output text.

# Autoencoders

![Autoencoder Diagram](image_url)

**An autoencoder neural network** is an unsupervised learning model that applies backpropagation, setting target values to be equal to inputs themselves, i.e. \( \mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{x}_i \).

## Diagram

- **Layer \( L_1 \)**: Input layer with nodes \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6 \).
- **Layer \( L_2 \)**: Hidden layer with nodes \( h_{W,b}(x) \).
- **Layer \( L_3 \)**: Output layer with nodes \( \hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2, \hat{x}_3, \hat{x}_4, \hat{x}_5, \hat{x}_6 \).

## Explanation

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of input data. The network aims to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction or feature learning. The autoencoder tries to reconstruct its input without losing important information, making it a useful tool for tasks like denoising, compression, and anomaly detection.

The autoencoder consists of two main parts:
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given an input vector \( \mathbf{x} \), the encoder maps it to a latent space representation \( \mathbf{h} \):
\[ \mathbf{h} = f(\mathbf{x}) \]

The decoder then maps the latent space representation back to the original input space:
\[ \mathbf{\hat{x}} = g(\mathbf{h}) \]

The goal is to minimize the reconstruction error:
\[ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{\hat{x}}) \]

Commonly used reconstruction errors include:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Applications

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features in the dataset.
- **Feature Learning**: Extract meaningful features from high-dimensional data.
- **Denoising**: Reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers by comparing the reconstruction error.

### Example

For a simple autoencoder with an input layer of size 6 and a hidden layer of size 3, the process can be outlined as:

1. **Input Layer**: \( \mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6] \)
2. **Encoder**: \( \mathbf{h} \) is obtained by compressing \( \mathbf{x} \) through a series of linear and activation functions.
3. **Decoder**: \( \mathbf{\hat{x}} \) is reconstructed from \( \mathbf{h} \).

The autoencoder is trained to minimize the difference between \( \mathbf{x} \) and \( \mathbf{\hat{x}} \).

**Denoising Autoencoders**

## Variant of autoencoder, where input is perturbed with noise (e.g. Gaussian), but network is asked to predict original input without noise

### Diagram Explanation

- **Original Input**: Represents the input data without any noise.
  - \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)

- **Corrupt Input**: Representation of the input after adding noise.
  - \( \tilde{x}_1, \tilde{x}_2, \ldots, \tilde{x}_n \)

- **Hidden Layer**: Intermediate layers of the neural network processing the perturbed input.
  - \( h(x) \)

- **Output Layer**: Final layer of the network where the original input without noise is predicted.
  - \( \hat{x} \)

### Process

1. **Input Vector**: Original input vector is corrupted by adding noise.
2. **Network Processing**: The corrupted input is passed through the network's hidden layers.
3. **Output Prediction**: The network predicts the original input without noise.

### Formula
\[ h_{WX}(x) \]

No student of a foreign language needs to be told that grammar is complex. By changing word sequences and by adding a range of auxiliary verbs and suffixes, we are able to communicate tiny variations in meaning. We can turn a statement into a question, state whether an action has taken place or is soon to take place, and perform many other word tricks to convey subtle differences in meaning. Nor is this complexity inherent to the English language. All languages, even those of so-called 'primitive' tribes have clever grammatical components. The Cherokee pronoun system, for example, can distinguish between 'you' and 't,' 'several other people' and 'I' and 'you,' another person and 't.' In English, all these meanings are summed up in the one, crude pronoun 'we.' Grammar is universal and plays a part in every language, no matter how widespread it is. So the question which has baffled many linguists is - who created grammar?

### Summary

- Grammar is inherently complex. This complexity is independent of how widely a language is used.
- If grammar is universal, who created it?

# Attention Mechanism: Temporal Data

## Vineeth N B (IIIT-H) §9.1 Attention Models in Vision

Given an encoder, with \( h_j \) as hidden state at time-step \( j \), and decoder, with \( s_l \) as hidden state at time-step \( l \).

h1     h2      ...           hj-1         hj             hT
```

### Explanation

- The encoder processes input sequences \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_T \) to produce hidden states \( h_1, h_2, ..., h_j, ..., h_T \).
- The decoder uses these hidden states to generate corresponding outputs \( y_1, y_2, ..., y_t, ..., y_k \).
- The hidden states at each time-step for both the encoder \( h_j \) and decoder \( s_l \) are crucial for the attention mechanism.

![Attention Mechanism Diagram](image_url)

- **Given an encoder**, with \( h_j \) as hidden state at time-step \( j \), and decoder, with \( s_l \) as hidden state at time-step \( l \)

- **Attention mechanism** creates shortcut connections between context vector \( (c_l) \) and the entire source input \( (X) \)

## Sections

### Temporal Data

- **Context Vector \( c_l \)**: 
```math
c_l = \sum_{j=1}^{T} \alpha_{lj} h_j
```
Where \( \alpha_{lj} \) represents the attention weights.

### Source Input \( X \)

- **Hidden States \( h_j \)**: 
```math
h_j = f(X_j)
```
Where \( f \) is the encoding function.

### Decoder Hidden States \( s_l \)

- **Decoder Hidden State \( s_l \)**:
```math
s_l = g(s_{l-1}, c_l, y_{l-1})
```
Where \( g \) is the decoding function.

## Notations

- \( y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_K \): Outputs at each time step
- \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_K \): Hidden states of the decoder at each time step
- \( h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_T \): Hidden states of the encoder at each time step
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T \): Inputs to the encoder at each time step

### Equations

- **Attention Weights \( \alpha_{lj} \)**:
```math
\alpha_{lj} = \frac{\exp(e_{lj})}{\sum_{k=1}^{T} \exp(e_{lk})}
```
Where \( e_{lj} \) is the alignment score between time step \( l \) and \( j \).

# Modes of Attention

## Hard vs Soft Attention:

![Hard Attention Image](image1.png)
![Soft Attention Image](image2.png)

### What is the boy doing?

- **Hard Attention:**
  - Single position is chosen for full alignment (1.0)
  - Position-choosing is stochastic and hence non-differentiable

- **Soft Attention:**
  - All positions get partial alignment weights (0-1)
  - Deterministic and hence differentiable, as no position-choosing
