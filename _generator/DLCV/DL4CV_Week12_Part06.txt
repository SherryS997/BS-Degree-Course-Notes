# Other Topics: Reinforcement Learning and Vision

- **Reinforcement Learning**: A paradigm of machine learning based where an agent takes actions and interacts with an environment to maximize total, potentially delayed, rewards; usually modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

- Uses in computer vision?

- Uses in computer vision? We already saw **hard attention** and **NAS** - which in turn have many applications!

- Other example use cases:
  - Games
  - Visual servoing
  - Visual tracking
