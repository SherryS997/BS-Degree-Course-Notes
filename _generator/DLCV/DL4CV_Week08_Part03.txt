## LSTM Components and Processes

### Key Components
- **Neural Network Layer**: Represented by yellow blocks.
- **Pointwise Operation**: Represented by circles.
- **Vector Transfer**: Represented by arrows.
- **Concatenate**: Represented by an arrow with a plus sign.
- **Copy**: Represented by an arrow with a circle.

### Processes
1. **Forget Gate**:
   - **Compute the forget gate**: Determines which information from the cell state \( C_{t-1} \) should be discarded. This is achieved by applying a sigmoid function to the input and previous hidden state.
   - **Forget some cell content**: The output is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means completely forget and 1 means completely keep.

2. **Input Gate**:
   - **Compute the input gate**: Determines which new information should be added to the cell state. This involves applying a sigmoid function to the input and previous hidden state.
   - **Write some new cell content**: The output is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means ignore the new information and 1 means completely add it.

3. **New Cell Content**:
   - **Compute the candidate values**: These are new potential values that could be added to the cell state. This is achieved by applying a tanh function to the input.
   - **Multiply by the input gate**: The candidate values are then multiplied by the input gate to determine which parts of the new information to keep.

4. **Output Gate**:
   - **Compute the output gate**: Determines which parts of the cell state should be outputted. This is achieved by applying a sigmoid function to the input and previous hidden state.
   - **Output some cell content to the hidden state**: The output is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means completely ignore the cell state and 1 means completely output it.

### Mathematical Representations
- **Forget Gate**:
  \[ f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \]
- **Input Gate**:
  \[ i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \]
  \[ \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \]
- **Cell State Update**:
  \[ C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t \]
- **Output Gate**:
  \[ o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \]
  \[ h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t) \]

- **What can you tell about cell state (\(C_t\))**? If forget gate is set to 1 and input gate set to 0?
  - Information of that cell is preserved indefinitely
- **What happens if you fix input gate to all 1s, forget gate to all 0s, output gate to all 1s?**

# LSTMs Explained

## Overview

This slide provides an overview of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, highlighting the role of various gates and the cell state mechanism.

## Gates in LSTM

The key components of an LSTM cell include:

- **Forget gate**: controls what is kept vs forgotten from the previous cell state.
- **Input gate**: controls what parts of the new cell content are written to the cell.
- **Output gate**: controls what parts of the cell are output to the hidden state.
- **New cell content**: the new content to be written to the cell.
- **Cell state**: erase ("forget") some content from the last cell state, and write ("input") some new cell content.
- **Hidden state**: read ("output") some content from the cell.

## Mathematical Formulation

The operations within an LSTM cell are governed by the following equations:

```math
f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
```

Where:
- \( f_t \) is the forget gate activation,
- \( i_t \) is the input gate activation,
- \( o_t \) is the output gate activation,
- \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function (values between 0 and 1).

The updated cell state \( \tilde{C}_t \) and cell state \( C_t \) are calculated as follows:

```math
\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + i_t \ast \tilde{C}_t
```

Where:
- \( \tilde{C}_t \) is the new cell content candidate,
- \( C_t \) is the updated cell state,
- \( \tanh \) is the hyperbolic tangent function.

Finally, the hidden state \( h_t \) is given by:

```math
h_t = o_t \ast \tanh(C_t)
```

## Cell State Analysis

- **What can you tell about cell state \( C_t \)?** If the forget gate is set to 1 and the input gate is set to 0?
  - Information of that cell is preserved indefinitely.

- **What happens if you fix the input gate to all 1s, forget gate to all 0s, output gate to all 1s?**
  - Almost standard RNN;
    - **Why almost?**
    - **Tanh** added here.

# LSTM: How does it solve the vanishing gradient problem?

![LSTM Diagram](image_url)

Vineeth N B (IIT-H)

## §8.3 LSTMs and GRUs

### Diagram Explanation

- **Top Diagram:**
  - **Inputs:**
    - \( x_t \): Input at time \( t \)
    - \( h_{t-1} \): Hidden state from the previous time step
    - \( C_{t-1} \): Cell state from the previous time step
  - **Process:**
    - The input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \) are combined.
    - This combination feeds into the LSTM network, which includes internal operations to compute new states.
    - **Outputs:**
      - \( h_t \): New hidden state
      - \( C_t \): New cell state
  - This diagram shows the flow through the LSTM, emphasizing the role of the cell state in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

- **Bottom Diagram:**
  - **Inputs:**
    - \( x_t \): Input at time \( t \)
    - \( h_{t-1} \): Hidden state from the previous time step
    - \( C_{t-1} \): Cell state from the previous time step
  - **Process:**
    - The input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \) are combined.
    - The cell state \( C_{t-1} \) is updated through several internal operations in the LSTM network.
    - **Outputs:**
      - \( h_t \): New hidden state
      - \( C_t \): New cell state
  - This diagram illustrates the internal mechanisms of the LSTM, showing how the cell state helps in preserving information over long sequences.

### Gradient "highway"

- **Concept:**
  - The cell state \( C_t \) acts as a "highway" for gradients, allowing them to pass through the network with minimal dissipation.
  - This mechanism helps in solving the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common issue in traditional RNNs where gradients can diminish exponentially over long sequences.

# LSTM: How does it solve the vanishing gradient problem?

```markdown
![LSTM Structure](image_url)

- **Gradient "highway"**
- **Gradient at C<sub>t</sub> passed on to C<sub>t-1</sub> unaffected by any other operations, but for forget gate; why does this not matter?**

```markdown
## Diagram Explanation

### Top Diagram
- **C<sub>t-1</sub>:** Previous hidden state
- **h<sub>t</sub>:** Current hidden state
- **C<sub>t</sub>:** Current cell state
- **Forget gate, Input gate, and Output gate:** Key components of the LSTM architecture that help control the flow of information.

### Bottom Diagram
- **x<sub>t</sub>:** Current input
- **h<sub>t-1</sub>:** Previous hidden state
- **h<sub>t</sub>:** Current hidden state
- **σ:** Activation function (Sigmoid)
- **f<sub>t</sub>:** Forget gate

### Explanation
- **Gradient "highway":** LSTM architecture allows for gradients to flow freely through time, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Gradient at C<sub>t</sub>:** The gradient at the cell state C<sub>t</sub> is specifically passed to the previous cell state C<sub>t-1</sub> without being affected by other operations, except for the forget gate.

### Key Points
- **Forget gate:** This gate decides which information from the previous cell state should be discarded or kept.
- **Input gate:** Controls which new information is added to the cell state.
- **Output gate:** Determines which information from the cell state will be output to the hidden state.

# Variants of LSTM

  - Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what to add, make decisions together

The image appears to show a variant of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, focusing on coupled forget and input gates. The accompanying formula represents the update rule for the cell state \(C_t\):

\[ C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + (1 - f_t) \ast \tilde{C}_t \]

Where:
- \(C_t\) is the cell state at time \(t\)
- \(f_t\) is the forget gate output at time \(t\)
- \(C_{t-1}\) is the cell state at time \(t-1\)
- \(\tilde{C}_t\) is the candidate cell state at time \(t\)

The variant appears to combine the forget and input gates, making a single decision on what to forget and what to add.
