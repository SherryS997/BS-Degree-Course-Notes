# Computer Vision: What and Why

## Why is it hard?

- **Many practical use cases are inverse model applications**

- No knowledge of how an image was taken or camera parameters - but need to model the real world in which picture/video was taken (shape, lighting, color, objects, interactions). ⇒ Need to almost always model from incomplete/partial noisy information

- Forward models are used in physics (radiometry, optics, and sensor design) and in computer graphics

- **Existing models largely related to subsystems, not holistic**
- **What is perceived, and what is cognized? When is an object important for a task, and when is the context important?**

- **What is perceived, and what is cognized? When is an object important for a task, and when is the context important?**

- **Verifiability of mathematical/physical models non-trivial**
- **How should similarity/dissimilarity between representations be defined? Is this a distance metric? Do all images follow such a distance metric?**
- **How would a manipulation (counterfactual) in a given (potentially noisy) environment behave, w.r.t. the captured image/video? Can a physical model capture this?**

**When a user takes a photo, the app should check whether they're in a national park...**

Sure, easy GIS lookup gives a few hours. ...and check whether the photo is of a bird. It'll need a research team and five years.
