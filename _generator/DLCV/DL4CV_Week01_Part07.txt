# Cost Improvement using Convolution Theorem?

## Convolution Theorem

- **Fourier transform of convolution of two functions is product of their Fourier transforms:**

  \[
  F[g * h] = F[g] F[h]
  \]

- **Convolution in spatial domain can be obtained through multiplication in frequency domain!**

  \[

# Cost Improvement using Convolution Theorem?

## Convolution Theorem

- Fourier transform of convolution of two functions is product of their Fourier transforms:
  \[
  F[g * h] = F[g]F[h]
  \]

- **Convolution** in spatial domain can be obtained through **multiplication** in frequency domain!
  \[
  g * h = F^{-1}[F[g]F[h]]
  \]

- Image convolution needs \(O(N^2 \cdot k^2)\) time, where \(N \times N\) is image size, and \(k \times k\) is kernel size

- By performing convolution in Fourier domain, cost is: \(O(N^2)\) for a single pass over the image + cost of FFT: \(O(N^2 \log N^2)\) for the image and \(O(k^2 \log k^2)\) for the kernel
  \[
  \approx O(N^2 \log N^2 + k^2 \log k^2), \text{ in total (other terms additive)}

This section discusses the concept of sub-sampling and its implications in sampling and interpolation. The images provided illustrate the effect of sub-sampling on a particular dataset.

### Sub-sampling Concept

Sub-sampling refers to the process of reducing the number of samples in a signal or dataset. This technique is often used to simplify data or reduce the computational complexity of processing large datasets.

### Visuals

The images shown above demonstrate the impact of sub-sampling on an image. The left image shows a standard-resolution image, while the right image displays the same image after applying sub-sampling. Notice how the details and resolution change between the two images.

### Anti-aliasing

Anti-aliasing is a technique used to prevent aliasing artifacts in digital images and signals. Aliasing occurs when the sampling rate is too low, causing high-frequency components in the signal to appear as lower frequencies. This can result in visual artifacts such as jagged edges or moiré patterns.

#### Principles of Anti-aliasing

1. **Shannon-Nyquist Theorem**: This fundamental theorem states that to accurately represent a continuous signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal.

   \[
   f_s \geq 2 f_{max}
   \]

2. **Pre-filtering**: Before sampling, a low-pass filter can be applied to attenuate frequencies above the Nyquist frequency (\( f_{Nyquist} = \frac{f_s}{2} \)). This helps to remove high-frequency components that could cause aliasing.

3. **Interpolation**: In the reconstruction stage, interpolation methods are used to estimate the values between sampled points. Common interpolation techniques include linear interpolation, polynomial interpolation, and spline interpolation.

   - **Linear Interpolation**: Interpolates data points linearly between sampled values.
     \[
     y(t) = y_0 + \frac{(t - t_0)(y_1 - y_0)}{(t_1 - t_0)}
     \]

   - **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: Uses cubic polynomials to interpolate data points, providing smoother curves and better accuracy.

   - **B-spline Interpolation**: A more generalized form of spline interpolation that offers flexibility and control over the interpolated curve.

### Implementation of Anti-aliasing

1. **Filter Design**: Designing an appropriate low-pass filter is crucial. Common filter types include Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Gaussian filters. The choice of filter depends on the desired cutoff frequency and the acceptable level of ripple.

2. **Filtering Process**: Apply the low-pass filter to the signal before it is sampled. This process ensures that frequencies above the Nyquist frequency are attenuated, reducing the likelihood of aliasing.

3. **Sampling**: Sample the filtered signal at the desired rate. Ensure that the sampling frequency satisfies the Shannon-Nyquist theorem.

4. **Interpolation and Reconstruction**: Use interpolation techniques to reconstruct the continuous signal from the sampled data. This step is critical for maintaining the signal's integrity and minimizing artifacts.

### Applications

Anti-aliasing is widely used in various fields, including:

- **Image Processing**: Prevents jagged edges and moiré patterns in digital images.
- **Signal Processing**: Ensures accurate representation of signals in digital audio and communication systems.
- **Computer Graphics**: Enhances the quality of rendered images by preventing aliasing artifacts.

### Conclusion

Anti-aliasing is an essential technique for preserving the quality of digital signals and images. By understanding the principles of sampling, filtering, and interpolation, one can effectively implement anti-aliasing to prevent aliasing artifacts and ensure accurate signal representation.

# Interpolation as Convolution

- To **interpolate** (or **upsample**) an image to a higher resolution, we need an **interpolation kernel** with which to **convolve** the image:

  \[
  g(i, j) = \sum_{k, l} f(k, l) h(i - rk, j - rl)
  \]

  Above formula similar to discrete convolution<sup>3</sup>, except that we replace \(k\) and \(l\) in \(h(\cdot)\) with \(rk\) and \(rl\), where \(r\) is the upsampling rate.

- Linear interpolator (corresponding to **tent kernel**) produces interpolating piecewise linear curves.
- More complex kernels e.g., **B-splines**.

<sup>3</sup> \( g = f * h \implies g(i, j) = \sum_{k, l} f(k, l) h(i - k, j - l) \)

## Types of Interpolation

### Ideal Reconstruction
- **sinc(x)**
  - Ideal reconstruction using the sinc function.
  - Represents the ideal case of signal reconstruction without any loss of information.

### Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation
- **Π(x)**
  - Uses the nearest point in the signal to estimate the value.
  - Simple but can lead to poor approximations, especially for signals with high frequency content.

### Linear Interpolation
- **Λ(x)**
  - Interpolates by drawing straight lines between the points.
  - Provides a better approximation than nearest-neighbor but still has limitations for complex signals.

### Gaussian Reconstruction
- **gauss(x)**
  - Uses Gaussian functions to reconstruct the signal.
  - Offers a smoother and more accurate reconstruction compared to linear interpolation.

### Diagram Descriptions

- **sinc(x)**
  - The sinc function is shown with its characteristic oscillations.
  - Ideal reconstruction is depicted as a smooth curve without any discontinuities.

- **Π(x)**
  - Step function representation of nearest-neighbor interpolation.
  - Displays a blocky approximation of the signal with sharp transitions.

- **Λ(x)**
  - Linear interpolation is visualized with straight lines connecting sampled points.
  - Illustrates a smoother approximation but still with visible inaccuracies.

- **gauss(x)**
  - Gaussian function is shown, highlighting its smooth bell-shaped curve.
  - Gaussian reconstruction is depicted as a much smoother curve compared to linear interpolation.

### Additional Diagram Components
- **Arrows**
  - Indicating the transformation from discrete points to continuous curves.
- **Dashed Lines**
  - Highlighting the difference between discrete sampled points and the interpolated continuous signal.

### Mathematical Notations
- **sinc(x)**
  - The sinc function is represented by \( \text{sinc}(x) \).
- **Π(x)**
  - The step function is represented by \( \Pi(x) \).
- **Λ(x)**
  - The linear interpolation is represented by \( \Lambda(x) \).
- **gauss(x)**
  - The Gaussian function is represented by \( \text{gauss}(x) \).

# Interpolation and Decimation

## Interpolation
To **interpolate** (or upsample) an image to a higher resolution, we need an **interpolation kernel** with which to convolve the image (r is upsampling rate):

\[ g(i, j) = \sum_{k, l} f(k, l) h \left( i - r k, j - r l \right) \]

## Decimation (Sub-sampling)
To **decimate** (or sub-sample) an image to a lower resolution, we need a **decimation kernel** with which to convolve the image (r is downsampling rate):

\[ g(i, j) = \sum_{k, l} f(k, l) h \left( i - \frac{k}{r}, j - \frac{l}{r} \right) \]
