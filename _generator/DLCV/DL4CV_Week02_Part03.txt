**Histogram** conveys 50% white pixels and 50% black pixels.

## How to represent textures?

- Compute responses of blobs and edges at various orientations and scales.
- Ways to process:
  - Record simple statistics (e.g., mean, std.) of absolute filter responses.

# Gabor Filters

- Special classes of bandpass filters (i.e., they allow a certain 'band' of frequencies and reject the others).
- A Gabor filter can be viewed as a sinusoidal signal of particular frequency and orientation, modulated by a Gaussian wave.

- A sinusoid oriented 30° with x-axis
- A corresponding 2-D Gabor Filter

# Steerable Filter Banks

Steerable Filters are a class of oriented filters that can be expressed as a linear combination of a set of basis filters.

- For an isotropic Gaussian filter, \( G(x, y) = e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} \),

\[ G_1^{\theta^\circ} = G_1^{0^\circ} \cos(\theta) + G_1^{90^\circ} \sin(\theta) \]
