   - Uses two cameras to capture images from different perspectives, allowing the computation of depth information based on the disparity between the images.
   - *Strengths*: Provides accurate depth information, especially for objects within a certain range.
   - *Weaknesses*: Sensitive to noise and occlusions.

2. **Structured Light**
   - Projects a pattern of light onto a scene and analyzes the deformation of the pattern to compute depth.
   - *Strengths*: High resolution and accuracy for near-range objects.
   - *Weaknesses*: Requires controlled lighting conditions.

3. **Time-of-Flight (ToF)**
   - Measures the time it takes for light to travel from a source to an object and back to a sensor.
   - *Strengths*: Provides depth information in real-time.
   - *Weaknesses*: Limited range and resolution.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- CNNs have become the state-of-the-art method for depth estimation.
- They can be trained on large datasets of images with known depth information to learn complex patterns and relationships.
- *Strengths*: High accuracy and robustness to various lighting conditions and occlusions.
- *Weaknesses*: Requires significant computational resources and large datasets for training.

### Applications
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Enables safe navigation by detecting obstacles and distances.

## Process Overview

- **Low-resolution image (input)**:
  - Original image with reduced detail and resolution.

- **Patch extraction and representation**:
  - The low-resolution image is divided into smaller patches.
  - Each patch is represented using feature maps.
  - Number of feature maps: \( n_1 \).

- **Non-linear mapping**:
  - The extracted patches are processed through a series of layers.
  - The dimensions of the feature maps change through these layers.
  - Initial layer: \( f_1 \times f_1 \).
  - Intermediate layer: \( f_2 \times f_2 \).
  - Final layer: \( f_3 \times f_3 \).

- **Reconstruction**:
  - The processed feature maps are reconstructed into a high-resolution image.

## Mathematical Representation

The transformation function \( F_1(Y) \) is given by:
\[ F_1(Y) = \max(0, W_1 \ast Y + B_1) \]

# Super-resolution using CNNs

## Process Overview

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Low-resolution Image (Input)**: Initial image with lower resolution quality.
- **High-resolution Image (Output)**: Final image with enhanced resolution.

### Steps
1. **Patch Extraction and Representation**: 
    - The low-resolution image is divided into smaller patches.
    - These patches undergo initial representation processing.

2. **Non-linear Mapping**:
    - The patches are mapped through a series of non-linear transformations.
    - This step involves multiple layers and functions (denoted as \( f_1 \times f_1 \), \( f_2 \times f_2 \), \( f_3 \times f_3 \)).

3. **Reconstruction**:
    - The processed patches are then reconstructed to form a high-resolution image.

## Example Results
- Three sets of images demonstrating the process:
  - The first image in each set is the low-resolution input.
  - The second image is the intermediate processed patch.
  - The third image is the final high-resolution output.

## 87.6 CNNs for Other Image Tasks

- **Anomaly Detection**

    - Input: Image data
    - Process: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to detect anomalies
    - Output: Identified anomalies

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are deep learning models particularly effective for image processing because of their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from 2D data.

#### Architecture

1. **Input Layer**
    - Shape: (H, W, C), where H is height, W is width, and C is the number of channels

2. **Convolutional Layers**
    - Apply filters (kernels) to the input to detect features
    - Activation functions (ReLU) applied post-convolution

3. **Pooling Layers**
    - Downsample the spatial dimensions (Max Pooling)

4. **Fully Connected Layers**
    - Flattened output from previous layers fed into dense layers
    - Activation functions (ReLU) applied post-convolution

5. **Output Layer**
    - Final layer produces the classified output
    - Activation function depends on the task (e.g., Softmax for classification, Sigmoid for regression)

### Example CNN Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 28x28 pixels with 1 channel (grayscale)
- **Conv Layer 1**: 32 filters of size 3x3
- **Pooling Layer 1**: 2x2 max pooling
- **Conv Layer 2**: 64 filters of size 3x3
- **Pooling Layer 2**: 2x2 max pooling
- **Flatten Layer**: Flatten the output into a single vector
- **Fully Connected Layer**: 128 neurons
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (corresponding to 10 classes)

### Workflow for Anomaly Detection

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Collect and preprocess image data
    - Normalize pixel values
    - Augment data if necessary

2. **Model Training**
    - Define the architecture using a framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
    - Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
    - Train the model on the dataset

3. **Prediction**
    - Input new images
    - Model processes and identifies anomalies

4. **Evaluation**
    - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
    - Visualize results and compare with ground truth

### Example Code

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the CNN model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model architecture
model.summary()
```

### Conclusion

- CNNs are powerful tools for anomaly detection in image tasks.
- Proper architecture, training, and evaluation are critical for effective anomaly detection.
- Continuous improvement and validation are necessary for real-world applications.

# Anomaly Detection<sup>3</sup>

![Image of the process](image-link)

## Process and Formulas

1. **Input Image**:
   - The process begins with an initial image input, depicted as the first step in the anomaly detection pipeline.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Layers**:
   - A series of CNN layers are applied to the input image. The layers are represented with varying dimensions (e.g., 64, 128).

3. **Energy-Based Model**:
   - The image processing flow leads to a mathematical formulation involving an energy-based model:
     ```math
     S_i(x; T) = \frac{\exp(f_i(x)/T)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(f_j(x)/T)}
     ```

4. **Gradient Descent Step**:
   - An iterative step involving gradient descent updates the image:
     ```math
     \hat{x} = x - \epsilon \text{sign}\left(-\nabla_{x} \log S_j(x; T)\right)
     ```

5. **Decision Function**:
   - A decision function determines whether the processed image is in-distribution or out-of-distribution:
     ```markdown
     g(x; \delta, T, \epsilon) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
     1 & \text{if } \max_i p(\hat{x}; T) \leq \delta \quad \text{(in-distribution)} \\
     0 & \text{if } \max_i p(\hat{x}; T) > \delta \quad \text{(out-of-distribution)}
     \end{array}
     \right.
     ```
