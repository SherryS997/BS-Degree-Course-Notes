## Diagram Explanation

The image formation process depicted in the diagram considers several key factors:

- **Light source strength and direction**: This determines the initial path and intensity of light rays.
- **Surface geometry, material and nearby surfaces**: These factors influence how light interacts with an object, including reflection and scattering.
- **Sensor capture properties**: Characteristics of the sensor, such as resolution and sensitivity, affect how light is captured and converted into an image.
- **Image representation and color**: The final output of the image, including its visual properties, is determined by the combined effects of the above factors.

# Models of Reflection

## When light hits a surface:

- Some light is **absorbed** (1 - ρ, ρ ≡ albedo);
  - More absorbed for low albedos

- Some light is reflected diffusively, independent of viewing direction
  - E.g.: Brick, cloth, rough wood
  - Lambert's cosine law: Amount of reflected light proportional to cos(θ)

- Some light is reflected specularly, depends on viewing direction
  - E.g.: Mirror

# Models of Reflection

- Most surfaces have both **specular** and **diffuse** components
- Intensity depends on **illumination angle** because less light comes in at oblique angles
- **Other possible effects**:
  - **Transparency**
  - **Refraction**
  - **Subsurface scattering**
  - **Fluorescence, phosphorescence**

- **BRDF - Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function**: Model of local reflection that tells how bright a surface appears when viewed from one direction when light falls on it from another

![Visible Spectrum](https://example.com/visible_spectrum.png)

### The visible spectrum for humans (light)

The visible spectrum for humans is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is detectable to the human eye. It ranges from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).

**Visible Spectrum Range:**
- Violet: 400 nm
- Indigo: 450 nm
- Blue: 475 nm
- Green: 525 nm
- Yellow: 575 nm
- Orange: 600 nm
- Red: 700 nm

### Coloured light arriving at sensor involves:

1. **Colour of light source**
2. **Colour of surface**

### Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies (or wavelengths) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths in the metric system:

### CCD vs CMOS: What's the difference?

CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) are two types of image sensors used in digital cameras and other imaging devices. Here are the key differences between them:

#### CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)

- **Operation**: Uses a series of capacitors to transfer data.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Generally provides a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
- **Power Consumption**: Typically higher power consumption.
- **Cost**: More expensive to manufacture.
- **Applications**: Often used in high-end professional cameras.

#### CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)

- **Operation**: Uses active pixel sensors where each pixel has its own transistor.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to CCD, but improving.
- **Power Consumption**: Lower power consumption, more efficient.
- **Cost**: Less expensive to manufacture.
- **Applications**: Widely used in consumer electronics and mobile devices.

#### Comparison Summary

- **Quality**: CCD generally provides better image quality.
- **Cost**: CMOS is cheaper to produce.
- **Power**: CMOS consumes less power.
- **Flexibility**: CMOS offers more flexibility in design and integration.

These differences have led to the use of each technology in different types of devices, depending on the specific needs and constraints of the application.

### CCD

- Move photogenerated charge from pixel to pixel, and convert it to voltage at output node
- An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) then turns each pixel's value into a digital value

- Uses several transistors at each pixel to amplify and move the charge using more traditional wires
- **CMOS** signal is digital, so it needs no ADC

# Popular Question: "With smartphones, do you need DSLR cameras?"

- **DSLR - Digital Single Lens Reflex camera**: Uses a mirror mechanism to reflect light from lens to a viewfinder, or let light fully pass onto image sensor by moving the mirror out of the way

  ![DSLR camera and smartphone](http://www.pixelrajeev.com/path/to/image)

- Essentially a comparison between mirror and mirrorless cameras

- **Pros of mirrorless cameras**:
  - Accessibility
  - Portability
  - Low cost

- **Pros of DSLRs**:
  - Picture quality
  - Versatility and functionality
  - Physical shutter
  - Variable focal length/aperture

# Sampling and Aliasing

![Sampling and Aliasing](https://example.com/sampling_aliasing.png)

**Shannon's Sampling Theorem:** \( f_s \geq 2 f_{max} \), where \( f_s \) is sampling rate, and \( f_{max} \) is maximum frequency in signal, also called Nyquist frequency

- Frequencies above Nyquist frequency or when Shannon's sampling rate is not met ⇒ **aliasing** happens

**Shannon's Sampling Theorem:** \( f_s \geq 2f_{max} \), where \( f_s \) is sampling rate, and \( f_{max} \) is maximum frequency in signal, also called **Nyquist frequency**.

- Frequencies above Nyquist frequency or when Shannon's sampling rate is not met \(\implies\) **aliasing** happens
- Why is aliasing bad?

## Shannon's Sampling Theorem

$$f_s \geq 2f_{max},$$

where $f_s$ is sampling rate, and $f_{max}$ is maximum frequency in signal, also called **Nyquist frequency**.

- Frequencies above Nyquist frequency or when Shannon's sampling rate is not met ⇒ **aliasing** happens
- **Why is aliasing bad?**
  - Creates issues while **downsampling** and **upsampling** an image
- More coming in later lectures

# Colour Space Representations

- Popular colour spaces: RGB, CMYK
- Additive colours: R, G, B
- Subtractive colours: C, M, Y
- Other colour spaces: XYZ, YUV, Lab, YCbCr, HSV
- Standards established by Commission Internationale d'Éclairage (CIE)
- Understanding of colour spaces important in printing industry

# Image Compression

- **Last stage in a camera’s processing pipeline**
- Convert signal into YCbCr (or variant), compress luminance with higher fidelity than chrominance
- Videos also use block-level motion compensation
- **Most common compression technique**: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), used in MPEG and JPEG
- DCT, a variant of Discrete Fourier Transform - a reasonable approximation of eigendecomposition of image patches
- Compression quality measured using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):
  \[
  \text{PSNR} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{I_{\text{max}}^2}{\text{MSE}} \right)
  \]
  where \(\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{x} \left[ I(x) - \hat{I}(x) \right]^2\)
  where \(\hat{I}\) is compressed version of \(I\)
