# StackGAN: Two-stage Network

## StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks, ICCV 2017

### Vineeth N B (IIIT-H) §11.1 GAN Improvements

This slide illustrates the architecture of StackGAN, a two-stage network designed for text-to-photo-realistic image synthesis using Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

### Overview

- The process starts with a text description as input.
- The network consists of two main stages: Stage-I Generator \( G_0 \) and Stage-II Generator \( G \), along with corresponding Discriminators \( D_0 \) and \( D \).

### Stage-I Generator \( G_0 \) for Sketch

1. **Text Description**:
   - Input text: "This bird is grey with white on its chest and has a very short beak."

2. **Embedding \( \Phi_t \)**:
   - The text description is converted into an embedding \( \Phi_t \).

3. **Conditioning Augmentation (CA)**:
   - The embedding is augmented to produce \( \Phi_z \) and \( z = N(0,1) \).

4. **Upsampling**:
   - The augmented embedding is fed into the Stage-I Generator \( G_0 \) to produce \( 64 \times 64 \) sketch results.

5. **Down-sampling in Stage-I Discriminator \( D_0 \)**:
   - The sketch results and real images are down-sampled and compressed.
   - Spatial replication is performed to match dimensions for comparison.
   - The discriminator \( D_0 \) outputs a probability \( \{0, 1\} \) indicating real or generated images.

### Stage-II Generator \( G \) for Refinement

1. **Conditioning Augmentation**:
   - The embedding \( \Phi_z \) is used for spatial replication and down-sampling to produce \( 128 \times 128 \) images.

2. **Residual Blocks**:
   - These blocks are used to refine the generated images further.

3. **Upsampling**:
   - The refined results are upsampled to produce \( 256 \times 256 \) images.

4. **Down-sampling in Stage-II Discriminator \( D \)**:
   - The refined results and real images are down-sampled and compressed.
   - Spatial replication is performed to match dimensions for comparison.
   - The discriminator \( D \) outputs a probability \( \{0, 1\} \) indicating real or generated images.

### Output

- The final result is a photo-realistic image generated from the initial text description.

and minimizing:

## Batch Normalization and SPADE

### Batch Norm

```markdown
- **Components**:
  - γ (gamma)
  - β (beta)

- **Process**:
  - Normalization: Adjusting input values to have zero mean and unit variance.
  - Scaling and shifting: Applying γ and β to normalized values.
  - Element-wise addition: Combining scaled and shifted values.

```

### SPADE

```markdown
- **Components**:
  - γ (gamma)
  - β (beta)
  - conv (Convolutional layers)

- **Process**:
  - Normalization: Adjusting input values similarly to Batch Norm.
  - Convolutional operations: Applying multiple conv layers to γ and β.
  - Element-wise multiplication: Combining normalized values with scaled and shifted outputs from conv layers.
  - Element-wise addition: Final combination of processed values.
```

### Key Points

- **Batch Normalization** provides affine layers.
- **SPADE** enhances Batch Normalization by incorporating convolutional operations for more dynamic scaling and shifting.

## Diagram Explanation

- **Convolution Feature Maps (x):** Input feature maps are processed through multiple convolutional layers.
  - **f(x):** One of the convolution outputs.
  - **g(x):** Another convolution output.
  - **h(x):** A third convolution output.

### Processing Steps

1. **Convolution Layers:**
   - Each feature map (x) is processed by 1x1 convolutional layers to generate intermediate feature representations.
   - The intermediate representations are denoted as f(x), g(x), and h(x).

2. **Transpose and Attention Mechanism:**
   - The intermediate feature maps are transposed and combined using an attention map.
   - The attention map is produced by applying a softmax function to the combined feature maps.

3. **Self-Attention Feature Maps (o):**
   - The self-attention feature maps (o) are generated by multiplying the attention map with the intermediate feature maps.
   - This mechanism enhances the feature representation by focusing on relevant parts of the input.

### Base Model
The base model used is **Self-Attention GAN (SAGAN)**.

### Training Loss
The model is trained using **Hinge Loss** defined as:
\[ \text{max}(0, 1 - t \cdot y) \]
where \( t \) is the target output and \( y \) is the predicted output.

# BigGAN: Class-conditional Latents

## Overview

The image depicts the architecture of BigGAN, a class-conditional generative model. The model uses a combination of linear transformations, residual blocks, and non-local operations to generate high-quality images conditioned on class information.

## Diagram Breakdown

### Inputs

- **z**: Latent vector
- **Class**: Class label

### Split

- The latent vector **z** is split into two parts.
- One part is fed through a series of transformations, while the other is concatenated with intermediate outputs.

### Linear Transformation

- **Linear (4x4x16ch)**: The split latent vector undergoes a linear transformation to 4x4x16 channels.

### Residual Blocks (ResBlock)

- **ResBlock**: The core building block of the architecture, consisting of multiple layers.
- **Concat**: The outputs from different stages are concatenated to retain information from previous layers.

### Non-local Operations

- **Non-local**: Enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data.

### Image Generation

- The final output is an image generated by the model.

## Residual Block (ResBlock) Details

### Structure

1. **BatchNorm**: Normalizes the input data to improve training stability and convergence.
2. **ReLU**: Applies a Rectified Linear Unit activation function to introduce non-linearity.
3. **Upsample**: Increases the spatial dimensions of the data.
4. **1x1 Conv**: Applies a 1x1 convolution to mix channels.
5. **3x3 Conv**: Applies a 3x3 convolution to capture spatial features.
6. **Add**: Adds the input to the transformed output (residual connection).
7. **BatchNorm**: Another normalization layer after the convolution.
8. **ReLU**: Another activation function for non-linearity.
9. **3x3 Conv**: Another 3x3 convolution to further process the data.
10. **Linear**: Final linear transformation to combine the features.

### Concatenation

- The output from the residual block is concatenated with the class information to condition the generation process.

## Conclusion

The BigGAN architecture leverages class-conditional latents and sophisticated neural network components to generate high-quality, class-specific images. This approach improves upon traditional generative models by incorporating both linear and non-linear transformations, as well as advanced techniques like residual connections and non-local operations.

# BigGAN: Other Design Decisions

- **Spectral Normalization**: Normalizes weight matrix \( W \) using spectral norm so that it satisfies Lipschitz constraint \( \sigma(W) = 1 \) (See Miyato et al, Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks, ICLR 2018 for details)

- **Orthogonal Weight Initialization**: Initialize weights in each layer to be a random orthogonal matrix (satisfying \( W^T W = I \))

- **Skip-z Connections**: Directly connect input latent \( z \) to specific layers deep in the network

- **Orthogonal Regularization**: Encourages weights to be orthogonal:
  \[
  R_{\beta}(W) = \beta \left\| W^T W - I \right\|_F^2
  \]

# BigGAN: Other Tricks/Hacks

- Updates discriminator model twice before updating generator model in each training iteration
- Model weights are averaged across prior training iterations using a moving average (similar to Progressive GAN)
- Large batch sizes of 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 images (best performance at 2048)
- More model parameters: doubled number of channels or feature maps (filters) in each layer
- **Truncation Trick**: Sample from truncated Gaussian (values above a threshold) as input at inference alone
