# Multi-Arm Bandit Problem

### Problem Formulation

The MAB problem conceptualizes actions as arms, each associated with a reward drawn from a probability distribution. The quest is to identify the arm with the highest mean reward, denoted as $\mu^*$, and consistently exploit it for maximum cumulative reward.

### Notations and Definitions

- **$r_{i,k}$**: Reward obtained when selecting the $i$-th action for the $k$-th time.
- **$Q(a_i)$**: Expected reward for selecting action $a_i$ based on historical experiences.
- **$Q(a^*)$**: The action maximizing the expected reward.
- **$\mu_i$**: True average reward for selecting action $a_i$.

## Estimating Expected Reward

The estimation of $Q(a_i)$ involves aggregating observed rewards for action $a_i$ and dividing by the number of times the action is taken. Mathematically:

$$Q(a_i) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n_i} r_{i,k}}{n_i}$$

Here, $n_i$ represents the number of times action $a_i$ is chosen.

## Updating Estimated Reward

The dynamic nature of the estimation process demands continuous updates. The formula for updating the estimate employs a learning rate ($\alpha$) to adjust for new information:

$$Q_{k+1}(a_i) = Q_k(a_i) + \alpha [r_{i,k} - Q_k(a_i)]$$

In this formula, $Q_{k+1}(a_i)$ is the updated estimate, $Q_k(a_i)$ is the current estimate, $r_{i,k}$ is the latest reward, and $\alpha$ governs the rate of adaptation.

## Challenges and Considerations

Navigating the exploration-exploitation dilemma requires a delicate balance. Striking the right equilibrium ensures optimal learning and maximizes cumulative rewards over time.

## Multi-Arm Bandit Analogy

An analogy is drawn to a slot machine (one-arm bandit) with multiple levers (arms), each having distinct probabilities of payoff. The challenge mirrors that of identifying the lever (action) with the highest probability of payoff (mean reward).

## Learning Rate ($\alpha$)

The learning rate ($\alpha$) serves as a crucial parameter influencing the rate at which the model adapts to new information. Choices of $\alpha$ lead to variations in the update rule, determining the emphasis on recent versus older rewards.

## Actions and Reward Probabilities
Consider two actions, $A_1$ and $A_2$, each having distinct reward probabilities. For $A_1$, the rewards are $+1$ with a probability of $0.8$ and $0$ with a probability of $0.2$. On the other hand, $A_2$ yields $+1$ with a probability of $0.6$ and $0$ with a probability of $0.4$.

## Exploitation Challenge
A challenge arises when choosing actions based on initial rewards. If, for instance, $A_2$ is selected first and a reward of $+1$ is obtained, there is a risk of getting stuck with $A_2$ due to its higher immediate reward probability. The same issue arises if starting with $A_1$.

## Exploration Strategies

### Epsilon-Greedy
The Epsilon-Greedy strategy involves a balance between exploitation and exploration. It mainly consists of selecting the action with the highest estimated value most of the time ($1 - \epsilon$), while occasionally exploring other actions with a probability of $\epsilon$. Here, $\epsilon$ is a small value, typically $0.1$ or $0.01$, determining the exploration rate. The strategy ensures asymptotic convergence, guaranteeing exploration of all actions in the long run.

### Softmax
The Softmax strategy employs a mathematical function to convert estimated action values into a probability distribution. The Softmax function is defined as:

$$P(A_i) = \frac{e^{Q(A_i) / \tau}}{\sum_{j} e^{Q(A_j) / \tau}}$$

Where:
- $Q(A_i)$ represents the estimated value of action $A_i$,
- $\tau$ is the temperature parameter.

The temperature parameter ($\tau$) controls the sensitivity to differences in estimated values. When $\tau$ is high, the probability distribution becomes more uniform, favoring exploration. Conversely, a low $\tau$ emphasizes exploiting the best-known action. Softmax also provides asymptotic convergence, ensuring exploration of all actions over time.

## Temperature Parameter ($\tau$)
The temperature parameter, $\tau$, is a crucial factor in the Softmax strategy. A higher $\tau$ results in a more uniform probability distribution, making exploration more likely. Conversely, a lower $\tau$ amplifies differences in estimated values, making the strategy closer to a greedy approach.

# Regret and PAC Frameworks

## Regret Minimization

### Definition of Regret

Regret, denoted as $R_T$, quantifies the total loss in rewards incurred due to the agent's lack of knowledge about the optimal action during the initial $T$ time steps. It is defined as the difference between the cumulative reward obtained by an optimal strategy and the cumulative reward obtained by the learning algorithm.

$$R_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \mu^* - \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T r_{a_t}(t)\right]$$

where:

- $\mu^*$ is the expected reward of the optimal arm,
- $r_{a_t}(t)$ is the reward obtained at time $t$ from action $a_t$,
- $a_t$ is the action selected by the learning algorithm at time $t$.

### Objective

The primary goal is to minimize regret by quickly identifying and exploiting the optimal arm. In dynamic scenarios, like news recommendation, where the optimal action may change frequently, minimizing regret becomes crucial for effective decision-making.

## Total Rewards Maximization

### Learning Curve

In the context of the multi-arm bandit problem, the learning curve represents the evolution of cumulative rewards over time. The objective is to minimize the area under this curve, signifying the loss incurred before reaching optimal performance.

$$R(t) = \sum_{\tau=1}^t \mu^* - \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=1}^t r_{a_\tau}(\tau)\right]$$

Here, $R(t)$ represents the cumulative regret up to time $t$.

### Quick Learning

In scenarios like news recommendation, algorithms must adapt swiftly to changing optimal arms. The emphasis is on achieving quick learning to minimize the region under the learning curve and accelerate the convergence to optimal performance.

## PAC Framework

### Definition

The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework aims to minimize the number of samples required to find an approximately correct solution. It introduces the concept of an $\epsilon$-optimal arm, where an arm is considered approximately correct if its expected reward is within $\epsilon$ of the true optimal reward.

$$|\hat{\mu}_a - \mu^*| \leq \epsilon$$

The PAC framework also incorporates a confidence parameter $\delta$, representing the probability that the algorithm fails to provide an $\epsilon$-optimal arm.

### Trade-off

Choosing suitable values for $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ involves a trade-off between the acceptable performance loss ($\epsilon$) and the confidence in achieving this performance ($\delta$). This trade-off ensures robustness in the face of uncertainty.

## Median Elimination Algorithm

### Round-Based Approach

The Median Elimination Algorithm divides the learning process into rounds. In each round, the algorithm samples each arm and eliminates those with estimated rewards below the median, reducing the set of candidate arms.

### Sample Complexity

The total sample complexity is determined by the sum of samples drawn in each round. The algorithm guarantees that at least one arm remains $\epsilon$-optimal with high probability.

## Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm

### Objective

The UCB algorithm aims to achieve regret optimality by efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation. Unlike round-based approaches, UCB1 selects arms based on upper confidence bounds of estimated rewards.

### Implementation

UCB1 is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. It provides practical performance in scenarios like ad or news placement, where quick learning and adaptability are crucial.

## Thompson Sampling

### Bayesian Approach

Thompson Sampling adopts a Bayesian approach, modeling uncertainty in the bandit problem through probability distributions. It leverages Bayesian inference to update beliefs about the reward distributions associated with each arm.

### Regret Optimality

Agarwal and Goyal (2012) demonstrated that Thompson Sampling achieves regret optimality. This means that, asymptotically, the cumulative regret approaches the lower bound, signifying optimal learning performance.

### Advantage over UCB

Thompson Sampling tends to have better constants than UCB-based methods, providing improved practical performance. It is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the underlying distribution of arms is uncertain.

# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

## Introduction

In the realm of reinforcement learning, the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm stands out as an effective strategy for addressing the multi-armed bandit problem. This algorithm offers a nuanced approach to the exploration-exploitation trade-off, mitigating the drawbacks associated with simpler strategies such as Epsilon-Greedy.

## Challenges with Epsilon-Greedy

### Expected Value Maintenance

In the Epsilon-Greedy approach, the algorithm maintains the expected values (Q values) for each arm. However, a crucial limitation arises during exploration. The algorithm, guided by a fixed exploration probability (Epsilon), often expends valuable samples on suboptimal arms.

### Wasted Samples and Regret Impact

The consequences of this exploration strategy are two-fold. Firstly, it results in wasted opportunities, as the algorithm neglects gathering valuable information about potentially optimal arms in favor of the suboptimal ones. Secondly, the impact on regret is substantial, particularly when selecting arms with low rewards.

## UCB: A Solution to Exploration Challenges

### Introduction of Confidence Intervals

UCB introduces a novel approach by not only maintaining mean estimates (Q values) for each arm but also incorporating confidence intervals. These intervals signify the algorithm's confidence that the true value of Q for a particular arm lies within a specified range.
\newpage

### Action Selection Mechanism

The key to UCB's success lies in its action selection mechanism. Instead of relying solely on mean estimates, it considers an upper confidence bound for each arm. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$\text{UCB}_{j} = \bar{X}_{j} + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln{N}}{n_{j}}}$$

Here,

- $\bar{X}_{j}$ is the mean estimate for arm j.
- $N$ is the total number of actions taken.
- $n_{j}$ represents the number of times arm j has been played.

This formulation balances exploration and exploitation, with the exploration term gradually diminishing as the number of plays ($n_{j}$) increases.

### Regret Minimization

UCB is designed to minimize regret, a measure of the algorithm's deviation from the optimal strategy. The regret for playing a suboptimal arm (arm J) is limited by:

$$\text{Regret}_{J} \leq 8 \Delta_{J} \ln{N}$$

Here,

- $\Delta_{J}$ represents the difference between the optimal arm's expected reward and that of arm J.

## Advantages of UCB

### Efficient Exploration

UCB efficiently focuses exploration efforts on arms with the potential for high rewards, reducing the occurrence of wasted samples on suboptimal choices.

### Regret Optimality

By limiting the number of plays for suboptimal arms, UCB minimizes regret and ensures that the algorithm converges towards optimal choices over time.

### Simplicity and Practical Performance

UCB's elegance lies in its simplicity of implementation, requiring no random number generation for exploration. This simplicity, coupled with its strong performance in practical scenarios, establishes UCB as a formidable algorithm for real-world applications.


# Contextual Bandits

## Introduction

The focus of this discussion is on addressing the challenge of customization in online platforms, specifically in the realms of ad selection and news story recommendations. The proposed solution is the utilization of contextual bandits, an extension of traditional bandit algorithms designed to incorporate user-specific attributes for a more personalized experience.

## Contextual Bandits: A Conceptual Framework

### Traditional Bandits vs. Contextual Bandits

Traditional bandit algorithms involve the selection of actions without considering any contextual information. Contextual bandits, on the other hand, extend this paradigm by introducing the consideration of features related to both users and the available actions.

### Motivation for Contextual Bandits

The motivation behind introducing contextual bandits arises from the inherent challenge of tailoring recommendations for each user. In the context of ad selection and news story recommendations, a one-size-fits-all approach proves inadequate. Contextual bandits address this by accommodating user-specific features in the decision-making process.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Individual Bandits per User: Training Difficulties

A significant challenge in implementing bandit algorithms for each user lies in the impracticality of training due to the extensive user base. Users' infrequent visits to pages make it challenging to accumulate sufficient training data.

### Grouping Users Based on Features

To overcome the challenges of individual bandits per user, a strategy is proposed wherein users are grouped based on a set of parameters such as age, gender, and browsing behavior. This grouping allows for a more efficient handling of user features.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Linear Parameterization of Features

In contextual bandits, the mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma$) of the reward distribution associated with each action are influenced by user features. This relationship is commonly expressed through linear parameterization. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$\mu_{a,s} = \mathbf{w}_a \cdot \mathbf{X}_s$$

Where:

- $\mu_{a,s}$ is the mean for action $a$ and user features $s$.
- $\mathbf{w}_a$ is the weight vector associated with action $a$.
- $\mathbf{X}_s$ represents the feature vector for user $s$.

### Contextual Bandits for Actions and Context

Extending the mathematical framework, features are considered not only for users but also for actions. This enhancement allows for a more nuanced approach, facilitating the reuse of information when actions change. The revised equation becomes:

$$Q_{s,a} = \mathbf{w}_a \cdot \mathbf{X}_s$$

Here, $Q_{s,a}$ represents the expected reward for action $a$ given user features $s$.

### LinUCB Algorithm

The LinUCB algorithm is introduced as a practical implementation of contextual bandits. It leverages ridge regression to predict expected rewards, creating a linear function of features. The ridge regression is expressed as:

$$\hat{\mathbf{w}}_a = \arg \min_{\mathbf{w}_a} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (r_{t,a} - \mathbf{w}_a \cdot \mathbf{X}_{t,s})^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf{w}_a\|_2^2$$

Where:

- $\hat{\mathbf{w}}_a$ is the estimated weight vector for action $a$.
- $r_{t,a}$ is the observed reward for action $a$ at time $t$.
- $\mathbf{X}_{t,s}$ is the feature vector for user $s$ at time $t$.
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.

### Advantages of Contextual Bandits

Contextual bandits offer several advantages:
- Personalized recommendations based on user features.
- Efficient learning and adaptation even when the set of actions changes.

## Contextual Bandits in the Reinforcement Learning Spectrum

Contextual bandits serve as a crucial link between traditional bandits and full reinforcement learning. While considering both actions and context, they do not explicitly address the sequence, providing a bridge in the learning spectrum.

# Full Reinforcement

## Full Reinforcement Learning Problem

### Sequence of Decisions
In contrast, the full RL problem involves a sequence of actions. Each decision influences subsequent situations, introducing complexity compared to the immediate and contextual Bandit problems.

### Delayed Rewards
Unlike Bandits, the RL problem deals with delayed rewards. The consequences of an action may not manifest immediately but rather at the conclusion of a sequence of decisions. This delayed reward challenges the agent to associate distant outcomes with earlier choices.

### Context-Dependent Sequences
Moreover, the sequence of problems in RL is context-dependent. The nature of the second problem depends on the action taken in the first, introducing an interdependence that was absent in contextual Bandit scenarios.

## Temporal Distance and Stochasticity
The concept of temporal distance in RL, where rewards are tied to actions in the past, is essential. Additionally, RL often involves stochastic environments, where variations or noise influence the outcomes.

### Stochastic Environment
Stochasticity in the environment implies uncertainty in the response to an action. For instance, in a maze-running scenario, the mouse's decision might lead to different outcomes due to environmental variability.

### Need for Stochastic Models
Stochastic environments are employed in RL due to the impracticality of measuring or modeling every aspect precisely. For example, even in a simple coin toss, various unobservable factors contribute to the randomness observed.

## Reinforcement Learning Framework

### Agent-Environment Interaction
The RL framework comprises an agent and an environment in close interaction. The agent senses the environment's state, takes actions, and receives rewards, leading to a continuous loop of interaction.

### Stochasticity in State Transitions
Both state transitions and action selections can be stochastic, adding an element of unpredictability to the RL setting. The agent's decisions are based on incomplete information and uncertain outcomes.

### Evaluation and Rewards
Central to RL is the concept of evaluation through rewards. The agent's goal is to learn a mapping from states to actions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over the long term.

## Temporal Difference in Rewards
The delayed and noisy nature of rewards in RL introduces the need for temporal difference considerations. Agents must predict future rewards based on their current actions, leading to a more intricate decision-making process.

### Example: Tic-Tac-Toe
Illustrating this, in a game of tic-tac-toe, a move made early in the game may strongly influence the eventual outcome, even though the final reward is received only at the game's end.

## Full RL Problem Solving Approach

### Sequence of Bandit Problems
To solve the full RL problem, a sequence of Bandit problems is employed. Each state-action pair corresponds to a Bandit problem that the agent must solve, and the solutions cascade to form a comprehensive strategy.

### Dynamic Programming
The solution approach aligns with dynamic programming, where the value derived from solving one Bandit problem serves as the reward for the preceding state-action pair. This recursive approach forms the basis for tackling the complexity of RL scenarios.
