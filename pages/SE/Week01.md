# Thinking of Software in terms of Components

## Introduction
In the contemporary landscape of online platforms, exemplified by industry leader Amazon, the intricate systems governing processes such as ordering and delivery are constructed incrementally. In contrast to a monolithic approach, these systems evolve feature by feature. This incremental strategy arises from the inherent uncertainty surrounding the complete set of required features at the project's inception.

## Components in Software Systems
Within the domain of software engineering, the concept of components assumes a pivotal role. These components serve as manageable units that facilitate collaborative efforts by different teams, each working on distinct facets of the system. These individual aspects are later integrated into a coherent whole. Importantly, effective collaboration is achieved by understanding a component's interface, which shields the intricacies of its internal workings.

### 1. Inventory Management System
**Purpose:** The Inventory Management System is designed to intelligently track and manage inventory.

**Definition:** This involves measuring quantity, location, pricing, and the composition of products available on platforms like Amazon.

**Customization:** Amazon's homepage dynamically updates based on factors such as purchasing trends, seasonal variations, customer demand, and logistical and analytical considerations.

### 2. Payment Gateway
**Purpose:** The Payment Gateway facilitates electronic payments, ensuring a seamless experience for buyers and sellers.

**Definition:** Serving as a service authorizing electronic payments (e.g., online banking, debit cards), the Payment Gateway acts as an intermediary between the bank and the merchant's platform.

**Process:** The gateway validates payment details, confirming their legitimacy with the bank before transferring the specified amount from the user's account to the platform.

## Incremental System Development
Large-scale systems, exemplified by the infrastructure of industry leaders like Amazon, do not materialize in a single endeavor. Instead, they are deconstructed into components or modules that can be independently developed before harmonious integration. This integration phase involves establishing communication pathways between the modules.

# Requirement Specification

## Introduction
In the realm of software engineering, a comprehensive understanding of a software system's components and their interactions is fundamental. This lecture explores the intricacies of the software development process, using the example of Amazon Pay, a mobile wallet, to elucidate key concepts.

## Amazon Pay Overview
### Features
Amazon Pay, a mobile wallet, facilitates digital cash transactions by offering a spectrum of features. Users can link credit/debit cards, bank accounts, and engage in various transactions, including recharges, bill payments, travel bookings, insurance, and redemption of rewards and gift vouchers. Two notable functionalities include the ability to add money and an auto-reload feature.

## Software Development Process
### 1. Identifying the Problem
Before delving into programming languages, the foremost step in the software development process involves a profound understanding of the problem at hand. This recognition sets the stage for subsequent development efforts.

### 2. Studying Existing Components
To gain insights into the intricacies of system components, a meticulous examination of existing elements, such as inventory management and payment gateways, is crucial. Additionally, studying analogous systems, like Paytm and PhonePe, aids in identifying essential features.

### 3. Defining System Requirements
The foundation of the development process lies in explicitly defining system requirements. These requirements, derived from a thorough analysis of existing systems, serve as the guiding principles throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Clients in Software Systems
### Definition of Client
Clients, referring to users of the software system, can be categorized as either external or internal entities. External clients are end-users or buyers, while internal clients encompass components within the system itself.

### Types of Clients
#### External Clients
For instance, in mobile banking software, external clients are bank customers utilizing features like account balance checks and money transfers.

#### Internal Clients
Internal clients may include teams within a company, such as an internal products team constructing an employee resources portal by collaborating with various departments.

### Software-to-Software Clients
In certain scenarios, software components, like payment gateways (e.g., Razer Pay), act as clients, facilitating communication between an e-commerce website and customers' banks.

## Importance of Gathering Requirements
### Significance of the First Step
Gathering requirements stands as the initial and crucial step in the software development process. This process ensures a holistic understanding of users or clients, and adherence to requirements at every stage is imperative for meeting end-user needs.

# Software Design and Development

## Introduction
Previously, we delved into the initial steps of the software development cycle, primarily focusing on the gathering of requirements. However, a common misconception arises at this junctureâ€”many individuals are inclined to proceed directly to coding. This session aims to dispel this notion through a practical example.

## Example: Implementation of Amazon Pay Feature
Consider a scenario where a small team is eager to implement the Amazon Pay feature based on gathered requirements. The tendency to immediately engage in coding poses several challenges that warrant careful consideration.

### Pitfalls of Skipping Design Phase
1. **Divergent Implementation Ideas:**
   - Developers may harbor disparate concepts regarding the feature's implementation.
   - Changes made by one developer could inadvertently impact others.
  
2. **Interconnected Components Challenge:**
   - Components developed by different individuals may intertwine, resulting in complications.
   - Lack of a holistic view impedes the seamless integration of features.

## The Significance of the Design Phase
The design phase serves as a crucial precursor to the coding phase, offering distinct advantages in the software development process.

### Creating a System Overview
The primary goal is to construct a comprehensive overview of the entire system. This macroscopic perspective aids in organizing the subsequent coding phase efficiently.

### Benefits of a Well-Executed Design Phase
1. **Consistency:**
   - Mitigates conflicts stemming from diverse developer perspectives.
   - Ensures a uniform comprehension of the codebase.

2. **Efficiency Enhancement:**
   - Precludes unnecessary alterations and errors during the implementation phase.
   - Facilitates punctual product delivery.

3. **Future-Proofing:**
   - Streamlines the addition of new features in subsequent phases.
   - Enables seamless integration into the existing system.

## The Development Phase
Following the design phase, the development phase entails collaborative coding efforts involving multiple developers. This phase often unfolds in a distributed manner, with team members situated in diverse locations and time zones. Collaboration tools such as GitHub play a pivotal role in this collective coding endeavor.

## Imperative Role of Documentation
Given the dispersed nature of development efforts, comprehensive documentation becomes imperative. This documentation, encompassing precise interface definitions, ensures a consistent understanding of code functionality among developers.

### Interface Definitions
Interface definitions are foundational descriptions outlining the actions that functions can perform. Distinctively, the focus is on delineating actions rather than delving into intricate implementation details. Such definitions stipulate the types of requests accepted and the corresponding format of responses. The flexibility for code modifications exists, provided the interface remains consistent.

## Collaborative Dynamics in Development
Collaboration during the development phase entails the coordinated efforts of multiple developers, often located in different time zones. Effective communication, facilitated through clear and concise interface definitions, is paramount to achieving seamless integration of components.

# Testing and Maintenance

## Introduction

In the preceding video, we explored the design and development phases crucial to software development. However, two additional pivotal phases demand our attention: Testing and Maintenance.

## Importance of Testing

Testing serves as a critical measure to ensure the alignment of software behavior with specified requirements. The existence of bugs and defects, if left unaddressed, may lead

 to substantial financial losses. For instance, a noteworthy study indicates that in 2002, software bugs resulted in a $60 billion loss in the U.S. economy, a figure that surged to $1.1 trillion in 2016. The failure to rectify such bugs can potentially precipitate severe catastrophes.

## Testing Granularities

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit testing directs its focus toward a singular component, often a class or function, examined in complete isolation.

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration testing scrutinizes the interaction and collaboration of different parts within the application, ensuring seamless functionality as a unified whole.

### 3. Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing verifies the fulfillment of user requirements. This testing stage bifurcates into:

#### Alpha Testing

Internal employees conduct alpha testing within a controlled environment, such as a lab or staging area.

#### Beta Testing

Actual users undertake beta testing in real-world scenarios, providing valuable insights into the software's performance.

## Maintenance Phase

### Purpose

1. **User Monitoring:**
   - Continuous observation of user activities and software usage.
   
2. **Code Changes:**
   - Implementation of code modifications for upgrades, including patch releases.
   
3. **Feature Addition:**
   - Introduction of new features to enhance software functionality.

## Example - Amazon Pay

### Post-Release Issues

After the release of a feature like Amazon Pay, potential difficulties or errors that users may encounter must be anticipated. Examples include missed conditions, failures, and UI issues specific to certain browsers.

### Maintenance Process

The maintenance phase involves a systematic approach where the development team identifies issues and engages in a continuous process of rectification to ensure optimal software performance.

# Waterfall (Plan and Document) Model

## Introduction

Software engineering is a discipline that advocates a systematic approach to the development of software through a well-defined and structured set of activities. These activities are commonly denoted as the software lifecycle model, software development lifecycle (SDLC), or the software development process model.

## Waterfall Model

### Sequential Phases

The waterfall model entails a linear progression of phases, with each phase following the completion of the previous one. These phases encompass gathering requirements, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. The approach is also recognized as the plan and document perspective.

### Drawbacks

Despite its structured nature, the waterfall model has notable drawbacks:

1. **Increased Cost and Time:** Modifications later in the process lead to elevated costs and time consumption.
2. **Client Understanding:** Clients may not fully comprehend their needs initially.
3. **Design Challenges:** Developers may face challenges in determining the most feasible design.
4. **Lengthy Iterations:** Each phase or iteration can span from 6 to 18 months.

## Prototype Model

### Concept and Execution

To address the drawbacks of the waterfall model, the prototype model advocates the creation of a working prototype of the system before the actual software development begins. The prototype, possessing limited functionality, is subsequently discarded or replaced with the final product.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Enhanced understanding for both clients and developers regarding project requirements.

**Disadvantages:**
- Augmented development costs.
- Inability to anticipate risks and bugs emerging later in the development cycle.

## Spiral Model

### Integration of Approaches

The spiral model amalgamates features from both the waterfall and prototype models. It unfolds in four distinct phases: determining objectives, evaluating alternatives, developing and testing, and planning for the subsequent phase. Each iteration involves a refinement of the prototype.

### Iterative Process

This model fosters an iterative process, where the refinement of the prototype occurs at each iteration. Unlike the waterfall model, requirement documents are progressively developed across iterations. Client involvement at the end of each iteration mitigates misunderstandings.

### Drawback

Despite its advantages, the spiral model still encounters a drawback: each iteration may extend from 6 to 24 months.

# Agile Development Principles and Practices

## Introduction

In our previous lectures, we navigated through the intricacies of the software development lifecycle, concentrating particularly on established models like the waterfall model. While these models, falling under the plan and document process category, brought structure to software development, they faced considerable challenges in meeting deadlines and adhering to specified budgets. Surprisingly, studies conducted from 1995 to 2013 indicated that around 80 to 90 percent of software projects encountered issues such as overdue timelines, exceeding budgetary limits, or even abandonment. This realization triggered a significant shift in software development methodologies.

## Emergence of the Agile Manifesto

Approximately two decades ago, in February 2001, a coalition of software developers convened to devise a more flexible software development lifecycle. This effort culminated in the creation of the Agile Manifesto, a document founded on four key principles. The manifesto aimed to address the shortcomings of traditional approaches, laying the groundwork for a more lightweight and adaptive software development process.

### Agile Manifesto Principles

1. **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:**
   - Emphasizes the importance of interpersonal dynamics within the development team and effective communication with clients.

2. **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - Prioritizes the delivery of functional software in increments over exhaustive documentation.

3. **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation:**
   - Advocates for active collaboration with customers to understand their needs rather than fixating on contractual minutiae.

4. **Responding to Change over Following a Plan:**
   - Encourages adaptability to change during the development process, emphasizing responsiveness.

## Agile Development Approach

The Agile development approach is characterized by its iterative and incremental model. Teams adopting Agile construct the software product in small, manageable increments through multiple iterations. This process involves developing prototypes for key features, promptly releasing them for feedback. Noteworthy Agile methodologies include Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, and Kanban.

### Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming incorporates key practices such as behavior-driven design, test-driven development, and pair programming. These practices contribute to a development environment centered around quick iterations and continuous feedback.

### Scrum

Scrum, another Agile methodology, divides the product development into iterations known as sprints, typically lasting one to two weeks. This approach facilitates breaking down complex projects into more manageable and actionable components.

### Kanban

In Kanban, the software is segmented into small work items, visually represented on a Kanban board. This visual aid enables team members to monitor the status of each work item in real-time.

## Choosing the Development Perspective

Selecting between the plan and document perspective and the Agile perspective depends on various factors. Key considerations include the fixity of requirements, client availability, system characteristics, team distribution, team familiarity with documentation models, and the presence of regulatory constraints.

### Factors Influencing Choice

1. **Requirements/Specifications Fixity:**
   - Are requirements/specifications mandated to be fixed upfront?

2. **Client Availability:**
   - Is the client or customer consistently available for collaboration?

3. **System Characteristics:**
   - Does the system possess characteristics like size and complexity that warrant extensive planning and documentation?

4. **Team Distribution:**
   - Is the software team geographically dispersed?

5. **Team Familiarity:**
   - Is the team already acquainted with the plan and document model?

6. **Regulatory Constraints:**
   - Is the system subject to numerous regulatory requirements?
