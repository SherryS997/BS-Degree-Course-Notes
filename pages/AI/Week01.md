## Evolution of Neural Networks

### Perceptron Era

The foundational era witnessed the inception of the perceptron, a single-layered neural network devised as a binary classifier by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943. However, the limitation of this era lay in the perceptron's ability to only classify linearly separable classes.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron

The subsequent evolution involved the introduction of the multi-layer perceptron by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams. This innovation addressed the limitations associated with linear separability, with the popularization of the backpropagation algorithm for training feedforward networks.

### Deep Neural Networks in Computer Vision

Deep neural networks, characterized by numerous hidden layers, emerged as a game-changer in computer vision tasks. The breakthrough in 2012 by Hinton, LeCun, and Bengio underscored the efficacy of deep neural networks in recognizing diverse object types. The general architecture encompasses input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.

## Training Process of Neural Networks

### Supervised Training

The training process predominantly involves supervised learning, wherein images are presented alongside their corresponding expected outputs. The iterative application of the backpropagation algorithm facilitates weight adjustments based on the disparity between predicted and expected outputs. Consequently, neural networks acquire the ability to classify and distinguish input data through repetitive exposure.

### Applications of Deep Neural Networks

# Minds and Machines

## Introduction to Intelligence and AI Goals

In the exploration of artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of intelligence takes center stage. AI endeavors to construct intelligent agents capable of complex problem-solving. A historical glimpse into European thinkers sheds light on the roots of AI ideologies.

### Galileo Galilei (1623)

In his 1623 publication, Galileo Galilei delves into the subjective nature of sensory experiences. He contends that taste, odors, and colors are subjective perceptions residing in consciousness. Galileo challenges the idea that these qualities exist inherently in external objects. Moreover, he posits that philosophy is expressed through the language of mathematics.

### Thomas Hobbs

Thomas Hobbs, often referred to as the grandfather of AI, introduces the notion that thinking involves the manipulation of symbols. He associates reasoning with computation, not in the contemporary sense of computers, but as a form of mathematical operations. Hobbs views computation as the sum of many things added together or the determination of the remainder when one thing is subtracted from another.

### René Descartes

Building on Galileo's ideas, Descartes extends the concept that animals are intricate machines, reserving acknowledgment of a mind solely for humans. He aligns thought with symbols and introduces the mind-body dualism, raising questions about the interaction between the mental world and the physical body.

## Early Concepts of Thinking Machines

The early stages of envisioning thinking machines were influenced by the use of punch cards in the textile industry's Jacquard looms.

### Jacquard Looms

Punch cards were employed to control patterns in textile looms. This concept of punched cards was later adapted for programming early computers, emphasizing a transition from controlling patterns to controlling programs.

### Charles Babbage and Augusta Ada Byron

Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor, conceptualized the Difference Engine and the Analytic Engine. Augusta Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron, collaborated with Babbage and is recognized as the world's first programmer. She envisioned computers going beyond mere number crunching, foreseeing applications in music composition and AI-like capabilities.

## Mechanical Calculators and Early Computers

The evolution of mechanical calculators and the emergence of early electronic computers marked significant progress in computational capabilities.

### Pascal's Calculator and Leibniz's Step Drum

Pascal's mechanical calculator incorporated Latin Lantern gears, performing basic arithmetic operations. Leibniz introduced the step drum, a mechanism for counting and representing numbers. Both contributed to the development of early calculating machines.

### ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)

ENIAC, the first electronic computer, boasted over 17,000 vacuum tubes. Despite its immense size and weight, it laid the foundation for electronic computing. Augusta Ada Byron's visionary insights into the potential of computers started to materialize with the advent of ENIAC.

Simon and Newell's hypothesis posits that a Physical Symbol System is both necessary and sufficient for general intelligent action, distinguishing it from sub-symbolic AI, where information is stored in weights without explicit symbols.

## Philosophical Considerations

### Copernican Shift

#### Galileo's Distinction Between Thought and Reality
Galileo Galilei's intellectual endeavors were marked by a profound separation between the realm of thought and the objective reality. This conceptual wedge laid the foundation for a nuanced understanding of how human cognition interfaces with the external world.

#### Copernicus' Challenge to the Geocentric Model, Emphasizing Subjectivity
Copernicus, through his revolutionary heliocentric model, not only challenged the prevailing geocentric view but also underscored the subjectivity inherent in our interpretations of celestial motions. This shift forced a reconsideration of humanity's position in the cosmos.

#### Human Creation of Mental Models; Reality Comprising Fundamental Particles
Humans engage in the active creation of mental models to comprehend the intricacies of reality. The Copernican Shift extends to the microscopic realm, where the abundant nature of fundamental particles renders them unsuitable as standalone elements of representation. Instead, reality is approached through disciplined ontologies, focusing on entities like atoms, molecules, or cells based on the context of study.

#### Illustration through the Powers of Ten Film
The Powers of Ten film serves as a captivating medium to illustrate the Copernican Shift, visually portraying the vastness and intricacies of the universe at different scales. This cinematic exploration emphasizes the dynamic interplay between our mental representations and the expansive reality they seek to capture.

## Representation and Reasoning

### Human Reasoning

#### Human Reasoning Involves Symbolic Representations
In the realm of human cognition, symbolic representations play a pivotal role in the process of reasoning. These symbols serve as cognitive tools that humans manipulate to make sense of the world around them.

#### Fundamental Particles Unsuitable as Elements of Representation due to Abundance
Despite the fundamental nature of particles, their sheer abundance makes them impractical as elemental units of representation. Human cognition necessitates a selective focus, leading to the adoption of more manageable entities like atoms, molecules, or cells, depending on the specific domain of study.

#### Representation Depends on the Focus of Study (e.g., Atoms, Molecules, Cells)
The choice of representation is intricately tied to the focus of study. Whether delving into the microscopic realm of atoms or exploring the complexity of biological systems at the cellular level, the selection of representational units is driven by the demands of the specific discipline.

#### Discipline-specific Ontologies Define Level of Detail in Representations
Discipline-specific ontologies play a crucial role in determining the level of detail embedded in representations. These structured frameworks provide a systematic approach to capturing and organizing knowledge within distinct domains.
