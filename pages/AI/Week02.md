# State Space Search

## Introduction to Search Algorithms in AI

In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, the study of search algorithms plays a pivotal role in problem-solving strategies. These algorithms, designed to explore the state space of a given problem, can be categorized into brute force search, informed search, and a general algorithmic approach. To illustrate these concepts, we delve into the map coloring problem, showcasing various problem-solving strategies.

## State Space Search

### Overview
State space search involves representing a problem as a graph, where each node represents a unique state, and edges denote possible moves between states. The primary goal of this course is to explore general search methods, incorporating heuristic techniques for improved efficiency. The methods under consideration include state space search and constraint processing.

### Components of State Space Search

#### 1. State Representation
States are representations of specific situations in a given problem. These states are treated as nodes within the search space graph, with each node denoted by a symbol, such as $s$. The state space, essentially an implicit graph, is defined by a move generation function.

#### 2. Move Generation
A move generation function is critical in navigating the state space. It determines the possible moves from a given state, producing a set of neighboring states. In functional terms, this function, denoted as $MoveGen(s)$, takes a state $s$ as input and returns a set of states, or neighbors, achievable from the current state.

#### 3. State Space Exploration
The exploration of the state space is facilitated by a search algorithm, which employs the move generation function to navigate through the graph. The algorithm terminates based on the results of a goal test function.

#### 4. Goal Test
The goal test function, denoted as $GoalTest(s)$, checks whether a given state $s$ is the desired goal state. It serves as the criterion for terminating the search algorithm.

## Search Algorithms Overview

General search methods are designed to create adaptable algorithms capable of addressing a variety of problems. The two primary approaches discussed in this course are state space search and constraint processing, with a primary focus on the former.

## Sample Problems in State Space Search

#### Problem Description
The water jug problem involves three jugs with different capacities, requiring the measurement of a specific amount of water.

#### Representation
States are described as a list of three numbers, representing the water levels in each jug.

#### Moves
Moves involve pouring water between jugs, and the goal test function is contingent on achieving the desired water measurement.

### 2. Eight Puzzle

#### Problem Description
The eight puzzle, a two-dimensional puzzle, requires rearranging tiles to achieve a specific configuration.

#### Representation

#### Goal Test
The goal test function checks whether the configuration matches the desired goal configuration.

### 3. Missionaries and Cannibals Problem

#### Problem Description
This classic problem involves transporting individuals across a river without violating specific constraints.

#### Representations
Various representations are discussed, including objects on the left bank or based on the boat's location.

#### Goal Test
The goal test function checks for a specific configuration that adheres to the constraints.

### 4. N-Queens Problem

#### Problem Description
The N-Queens problem requires placing N queens on an N×N chessboard with no mutual attacks.

#### Representation
Solving involves finding a valid arrangement of queens on the chessboard.

### 5. Traveling Salesman Problem

#### Problem Description
The traveling salesman problem involves finding the optimal tour, with the lowest cost, visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting city.

#### Objective
The objective is to discover the tour with the lowest cost, a challenging problem with factorial time complexity.

### 6. Maze Solving

#### Problem Description
Maze solving requires finding a path through a maze from the entrance to the exit.

#### Representation
The maze can be represented as a graph, with each node representing a choice point.

#### Goal
The goal is to find a path through the maze to reach the exit.

# General Search Algorithms

## Introduction

In the pursuit of developing domain-independent problem-solving algorithms within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), the focus is on general search algorithms. These algorithms aim to provide solutions to diverse problems in a domain-independent form. This discussion revolves around two key algorithms: "Simple Search 1" and its modification, "Simple Search 2."

## Components of State Space Search

### 1. Start and Goal States

The state space comprises a set of states, a defined start state, and a specified goal state. These elements form the foundational framework for problem-solving in AI.

### 2. Move Gen Function

The move generation function, denoted as $ \text{{move gen}}(n) $, serves as a domain-specific function responsible for generating the neighbors of a given node $ n $. Importantly, it dynamically constructs the graph as the algorithm progresses.

### 3. Goal Test Function

The goal test function, $ \text{{isGoal}}(n) $, determines whether a given state $ n $ aligns with the defined goal state. This function plays a crucial role in assessing the success of the search algorithm.

### 4. Scene Nodes and Candidate Nodes

In the process of state space search, two categories of nodes emerge: scene nodes and candidate nodes.
   - **Scene Nodes:** These nodes represent states that have been visited and tested for the goal. They are stored in a set or list termed "closed."
   - **Candidate Nodes:** Generated by the move gen function, these nodes are candidates for exploration but have not yet been visited. They are stored in a set or list referred to as "open."

## Simple Search 1 Algorithm

### Algorithm Overview

The "Simple Search 1" algorithm adheres to the generate-and-test approach, a fundamental strategy in AI problem-solving. The algorithm iteratively generates nodes, tests them for the goal, and continues until either the goal is found or the open set becomes empty.

### Node Selection

A node is selected from the open set. If this node corresponds to the goal state, the algorithm terminates successfully. Otherwise, the process continues.

### Graph Exploration

The algorithm leverages the move gen function to generate neighbors of the selected node. These generated nodes are then added to the open set for further exploration.

### Pseudocode for Simple Search 1

```plaintext
OPEN ← {S}
while OPEN is not empty
   Pick some node N from OPEN
   OPEN ← OPEN - {N}
   if GoalTest(N) = TRUE
     return N
   else 
     OPEN ← OPEN ∪ MoveGen(N)
return null
```

### Challenge - Cyclic Exploration

A notable challenge with "Simple Search 1" is its susceptibility to entering cycles, leading to the revisiting of nodes without making progress. This cyclic exploration issue poses a potential impediment to the algorithm's effectiveness.

## Simple Search 2 Algorithm

### Introduction of Closed Set

To address the cyclic exploration problem, "Simple Search 2" introduces a new set named "closed." This set serves as a repository for scene nodes, preventing their reevaluation during the search process.

### Purpose of Closed Set

The closed set's primary function is to avoid revisiting nodes already assessed for the goal. By maintaining a record of scene nodes, the algorithm reduces the search space and mitigates the cyclic exploration challenge.

### Algorithm Adjustment

The node selected from the open set is now moved to the closed set before testing for the goal. Additionally, during the generation of neighbors, nodes already present in the closed set are excluded from being added to the open set.

### Pseudocode for Simple Search 2

```plaintext
OPEN ← {S}
CLOSED ← empty set
while OPEN is not empty
   Pick some node N from OPEN
   OPEN ← OPEN – {N}
   CLOSED ← CLOSED ∪ {N}
   if GoalTest(N) = TRUE 
     return N 
   else 
     OPEN ← OPEN ∪ (MoveGen(N) – CLOSED)
return null  
```

### Improved Exploration

"Simple Search 2" demonstrates enhanced efficiency by minimizing the search space. The exclusion of nodes already visited contributes to a more focused exploration, addressing the cyclic exploration issue encountered in "Simple Search 1."

## Consideration - Solution Path

While both algorithms aim to find the goal node, it's essential to note that they do not provide the solution path. The goal test confirms the existence of a solution without specifying the sequence of states leading to it. Further considerations may be necessary to obtain the complete solution path.

## Impact of Algorithm Choice

The choice of algorithm significantly influences the exploration of the search space. Different algorithms may yield distinct search spaces for the same state space. The efficiency and effectiveness of the search process hinge on the algorithm's ability to circumvent cyclic exploration and avoid unnecessary node revisits.

# Planning Problems, Configuration Problems

## Problem Classification

In the realm of state space search, two distinctive problem types emerge: Configuration Problems and Planning Problems.

### Configuration Problems
Configuration problems involve seeking a state that satisfies a given description. For instance, classic problems like the N-Queens puzzle, Sudoku, Map Coloring, and others fall into this category. The primary objective is to identify a state that adheres to the specified criteria.

### Planning Problems
Contrarily, planning problems revolve around scenarios where the goal is either explicitly known or described, and the pursuit is directed towards determining the optimal path to that goal. This type includes real-world situations such as finding a suitable restaurant, where the algorithm must discern both the destination and the most efficient route.

## Graph Representation

In the context of state space search, the graph serves as the fundamental model. Each node within this graph represents a unique state. However, in planning problems, the goal extends beyond merely reaching the final state; it includes the necessity to ascertain the path leading to that state.

### Node Pairs
To address this, the concept of node pairs is introduced. In this representation, every node is accompanied by information about its parent node. This augmentation proves pivotal when reconstructing the path to the goal.

## Path Reconstruction

Efficient path reconstruction relies on the inclusion of node pairs within the search space. As the algorithm traverses the search space and identifies the goal state, the closed list—housing node pairs—facilitates the backward tracing of the path. Each node pair encapsulates information about the current node and its parent, enabling a step-by-step reconstruction.

## Search Algorithm Overview

The overarching search algorithm is designed to systematically explore the search space, attempting different paths until a viable route to the goal state is discovered.

### Deterministic Approach
In contrast to the initial non-deterministic approach of picking any node from the open set, the algorithm undergoes a modification. It transitions to a deterministic strategy, consistently selecting the node positioned at the head of the open list.

### List Structure
The traditional use of sets for open and closed is superseded by the adoption of lists. This shift is accompanied by a preference for adding new nodes to a specified location in the list, influencing their order and impact on the search algorithm.

## Notational Conventions

### List Notation
- The empty list is represented as square brackets: $[]$.
- Operations include the colon operator for adding an element to the head of a list and the plus plus operator for appending two lists.
- Essential functions, such as head and tail, serve in extracting elements and conducting tests.

### Tuple Notation
Tuples, denoted by parentheses, accommodate ordered elements. Accessing tuple elements involves positional identification or leveraging built-in functions like first and second.

## Algorithm Refinement

The transition from non-deterministic node selection to a deterministic strategy represents a pivotal refinement. This evolution ensures the consistent selection of the node residing at the forefront of the open list. Additionally, the determination of where new nodes are inserted in the list assumes significance, shaping their influence on the algorithm's behavior.


# Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a systematic algorithm for traversing and searching through the state space of a problem. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The algorithm is outlined as follows:

## Initialization
```plaintext
- OPEN ← (S, null) : []
- CLOSED ← empty list
```
The algorithm starts with an open list containing the start node `(S, null)` where `S` is the start node, and `null` represents the absence of a parent. The CLOSED list is initially empty.

## Main Algorithm
```plaintext
- while OPEN is not empty
  - nodePair ← head OPEN
  - (N, _) ← nodePair
  - if GoalTest(N) = TRUE
    - return RECONSTRUCTPATH(nodePair, CLOSED)
  - else CLOSED ← nodePair : CLOSED
    - neighbours ← MoveGen(N)
    - newNodes ← REMOVESEEN(neighbours, OPEN, CLOSED)
    - newPairs ← MAKEPAIRS(newNodes, N)
    - OPEN ← newPairs ++ (tail OPEN)
- return empty list
```
The algorithm iteratively selects the first element from the open list and explores the node `(N, _)`. If the goal test is satisfied, it calls the `RECONSTRUCTPATH` function. Otherwise, it adds the node pair to the closed list, generates and filters the children using `REMOVESEEN`, creates pairs with parents using `MAKEPAIRS`, and appends them to the front of the open list.

## Ancillary Functions
### RECONSTRUCTPATH Function
```plaintext
- RECONSTRUCTPATH(nodePair, CLOSED)
  - SKIPTO(parent, nodePairs)
    - if parent = first head nodePairs
      - return nodePairs
    - else return SKIPTO(parent, tail nodePairs)
  - (node, parent) ← nodePair
  - path ← node : []
  - while parent is not null
    - path ← parent : path
    - CLOSED ← SKIPTO(parent, CLOSED)
    - (_, parent) ← head CLOSED
  - return path
```
The `RECONSTRUCTPATH` function traces back from the goal node to the start node using parent pointers stored in the CLOSED list.

### MAKEPAIRS Function
```plaintext
- MAKEPAIRS(nodeList, parent)
  - if nodeList is empty
    - return empty list
  - else return (head nodeList, parent) : MAKEPAIRS(tail nodeList, parent)
```
The `MAKEPAIRS` function takes a list of nodes and a parent, creating pairs with each node and the given parent.

### REMOVESEEN Function
```plaintext
- REMOVESEEN(nodeList, OPEN, CLOSED)
  - if nodeList is empty
    - return empty list
  - else node ← head nodeList
    - if OCCURSIN(node, OPEN) or OCCURSIN(node, CLOSED)
      - return REMOVESEEN(tail nodeList, OPEN, CLOSED)
    - else return node : REMOVESEEN(tail nodeList, OPEN, CLOSED)
```
The `REMOVESEEN` function filters out nodes already present in the OPEN or CLOSED lists.

# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another systematic algorithm for traversing and searching through the state space. It explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. The algorithm is structurally similar to DFS with the key difference in how new nodes are added to the OPEN list.

## Initialization
```plaintext
- OPEN ← (S, null) : []
- CLOSED ← empty list
```
Similar to DFS, BFS starts with an open list containing the start node `(S, null)` and an empty CLOSED list.

## Main Algorithm
```plaintext
- while OPEN is not empty
  - nodePair ← head OPEN
  - (N, _) ← nodePair
  - if GoalTest(N) = TRUE
    - return RECONSTRUCTPATH(nodePair, CLOSED)
  - else CLOSED ← nodePair : CLOSED
    - neighbours ← MoveGen(N)
    - newNodes ← REMOVESEEN(neighbours, OPEN, CLOSED)
    - newPairs ← MAKEPAIRS(newNodes, N)
    - OPEN ← (tail OPEN) ++ newPairs
- return empty list
```
The main algorithm for BFS is identical to DFS, except for the addition of new nodes to the end of the OPEN list.

# Analysis of Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Analysis of DFS

### Overview
Depth First Search (DFS) is a search algorithm employed in problem-solving within the field of Artificial Intelligence. It is characterized by its treatment of the open set as a stack, following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

### Exploration Strategy
DFS explores the search tree in a deep-first manner, descending into the tree until it reaches a dead end. Upon encountering a dead end, the algorithm backtracks to explore alternative paths.

### Behavior
DFS tends to find paths that are farther from the source node, emphasizing deep exploration rather than a systematic examination of all possibilities. It exhibits a distinct behavior of diving deep into the search tree.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of DFS is exponential and can be expressed as $O(b^d)$, where $b$ represents the branching factor of the search tree, and $d$ is the depth. This exponential growth can lead to infinite loops in scenarios with infinite search spaces.

### Space Complexity
DFS demonstrates linear space complexity. The space required is proportional to the depth of the search tree, making it more space-efficient compared to other algorithms with exponential space growth.

## Analysis of BFS

### Overview
Breadth First Search (BFS) is another search algorithm used in problem-solving for Artificial Intelligence. Unlike DFS, BFS treats the open set as a queue, adhering to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Exploration Strategy
BFS explores the search tree level by level, starting from the source node and moving outward systematically. It ensures a conservative approach by prioritizing paths closer to the source.

### Behavior
BFS is designed to find paths that are closer to the source node, ensuring a more methodical exploration of the search tree. It guarantees the discovery of the shortest path due to its systematic approach.

### Time Complexity
Similar to DFS, BFS exhibits exponential time complexity, expressed as $O(b^d)$, where $b$ is the branching factor, and $d$ is the depth. However, BFS explores paths of increasing length systematically, ensuring the identification of the shortest path.

### Space Complexity
BFS has exponential space complexity, with the size of the open set growing exponentially. This makes BFS less space-efficient compared to DFS, but it guarantees finding the shortest path.

## Comparison

### Time Complexity
Both DFS and BFS share exponential time complexity, posing challenges in scenarios with large search trees.

### Space Complexity
DFS outperforms BFS in terms of space efficiency, having linear space complexity compared to BFS's exponential growth.

### Quality of Solution
DFS does not guarantee the shortest path, while BFS ensures the identification of the shortest path due to its systematic exploration.

### Completeness
DFS may not be complete, especially in infinite search spaces, where it can get lost in infinite paths. On the other hand, BFS is complete, provided there exists a path of finite length from the source to the goal.

# Search Methods for Problem Solving

## Search Space Characteristics and Solution Strategies

### Infinite Search Space Dilemma
When confronted with an infinite search space, the choice between Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) becomes contingent upon the problem's specifics. BFS is the preferred option if the search space is infinite but a solution is known to exist. Conversely, DFS might be more suitable if the search space is finite, albeit without guaranteeing the shortest path.

## Depth-Bounded Depth-First Search

### Strategy Overview
Depth-Bounded Depth-First Search strikes a balance between the characteristics of DFS and BFS. It limits the exploration depth, ensuring linear space complexity while compromising on completeness and the guarantee of finding the shortest path. The algorithm delves into the search space up to a specified depth, potentially missing the goal if it exceeds this depth.

## Depth-Bounded DFS with Node Counting

### Enhanced Exploration
An augmentation to Depth-Bounded DFS involves incorporating node counting during the search process. This count of visited nodes provides additional insights, proving advantageous in certain problem scenarios and facilitating subsequent analysis.

## Depth-First Iterative Deepening (DFID)

### Iterative Depth Expansion
DFID emerges as a solution that combines the strengths of DFS and BFS. It iteratively increases the depth limit for DFS until a solution is encountered. The algorithm mitigates the risk of failing to find a path due to depth constraints but introduces the challenge of revisiting nodes multiple times. The careful tracking of node counts prevents infinite loops and enhances overall efficiency.

## Path Reconstruction Challenges

### Dilemma Overview
Path reconstruction poses challenges, particularly when multiple paths to the goal exist. The lecture delves into the complexities of maintaining closed lists and the importance of judiciously selecting parents during the path reconstruction process.

## DFID in Chess Programming

### Tactical Application
DFID finds practical application in chess programming, particularly in scenarios where players face time constraints. The algorithm's iterative deepening approach accommodates the limited time available for move selection.

## Combinatorial Explosion and DFID

### Coping with Exponential Growth
The lecture acknowledges the pervasive issue of combinatorial explosion, where search trees exhibit exponential growth. DFID addresses this challenge by iteratively searching with incrementally expanding depth limits. An in-depth analysis delves into the trade-offs between time and space, revealing the algorithm's resilience in the face of increasing complexities.

## Blind (Uninformed) Search

### Fixed Behaviors
Blind searches, including DFS, BFS, and DFID, are characterized as uninformed strategies. These approaches lack awareness of the goal's location during exploration, adhering to predetermined behaviors irrespective of the goal's position.

# Depth-First Iterative Deepening (DFID)

Depth-First Iterative Deepening (DFID) is a search algorithm that combines the depth-first search (DFS) strategy with iterative deepening. The objective is to search the solution space while maintaining a balance between space complexity and optimality in finding the shortest path.

    else OPEN = tail OPEN 

return (count, empty list)

    else CLOSED ← nodePair : CLOSED 
    
    if depth < depthBound 
        neighbours ← MoveGen(N)
        newNodes ← SEE(neighbours, OPEN, CLOSED)
        newPairs ← MAKEPAIRS(newNodes, N, depth + 1 )
        OPEN ← newPairs ++ tail OPEN 
        
        count ← count + length newPairs
    
    else OPEN = tail OPEN 

return (count, empty list)
