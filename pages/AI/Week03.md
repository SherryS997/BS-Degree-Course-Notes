# Heuristic Search

## Introduction

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the quest for efficient problem-solving algorithms has led to the development of heuristic search methods. Unlike blind search algorithms, which explore the search space without any sense of direction, heuristic search algorithms leverage domain-specific knowledge to guide their exploration towards promising regions.

## Blind Search Algorithms

Blind search algorithms, such as Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Iterative Deepening (DFID), navigate the search space without considering the location of the goal. These algorithms follow predetermined trajectories, regardless of the goal's position.

## Heuristic Search: A Sense of Direction

Heuristic search introduces a sense of direction by incorporating heuristic functions, which estimate the distance of each node from the goal. This allows the algorithm to prioritize nodes that are closer to the goal, leading to more efficient exploration of the search space.

### Inspiration from Nature

Nature often provides inspiration for solving complex problems. In the case of heuristic search, the concept of gravity serves as a metaphor. Similar to how water flows downhill, guided by the pull of gravity, heuristic search algorithms aim to "flow" towards regions with lower estimated distances to the goal.

### Heuristic Function

A crucial component of heuristic search is the heuristic function, denoted as $h(N)$, which assigns a numerical value to each node representing its estimated distance from the goal. These values guide the search algorithm in selecting the most promising nodes for exploration.

## Types of Heuristic Functions

Heuristic functions can vary based on the problem domain and the specific characteristics of the problem being solved. Two common types of heuristic functions are:

### Hamming Distance ($h_1$)

The Hamming distance heuristic, denoted as $h_1$, counts the number of elements that are out of place in a given state compared to the goal state. It provides a simple measure of proximity to the goal, where lower values indicate states that are closer to the goal.

### Manhattan Distance

The Manhattan distance heuristic calculates the total distance that each element must move to reach its goal position. It is particularly useful for grid-based problems where movements are restricted to horizontal and vertical directions. The Manhattan distance is computed as follows:

$$
h_{\text{Manhattan}}(N) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| x_i - x_{\text{goal}} \right| + \left| y_i - y_{\text{goal}} \right|
$$

where $(x_i, y_i)$ represents the coordinates of element $i$ in the current state $N$, and $(x_{\text{goal}}, y_{\text{goal}})$ represents the coordinates of the goal position.

## Application of Heuristic Search

Heuristic search algorithms, such as Best First Search, find applications in various domains, including route finding, puzzle solving, and optimization problems. These algorithms leverage heuristic functions to efficiently navigate large search spaces and find optimal solutions.

### Best First Search Algorithm

The Best First Search algorithm prioritizes nodes for exploration based on their heuristic values, aiming to minimize the estimated distance to the goal. The algorithm operates as follows:

1. `OPEN <- (S, null, h(S)) : []`
2. `CLOSED <- empty list`
3. `while OPEN is not empty`
    4. `nodePair <- head OPEN`
    5. `(N, _, _) <- nodePair`
    6. `if GoalTest(N) = TRUE`
        7. `return RECONSTRUCTPATH(nodePair, CLOSED)`
    8. `else CLOSED <- nodePair : CLOSED`
        9. `neighbours <- MoveGen(N)`
        10. `newNodes <- REMOVESEEN(neighbours, OPEN, CLOSED)`
        11. `newPairs <- MAKEPAIRS(newNodes, N)`
    12. `OPEN <- sort_h(newPairs ++ tail OPEN)`
13. `return empty list` 

## Real-world Examples

Heuristic search algorithms are applied to real-world problems to find optimal solutions efficiently. Two examples illustrate the application of heuristic search in different domains:

### Geographical Route Finding

In geographical route finding, heuristic search aids in identifying optimal routes between locations. By considering factors such as distance and terrain, the algorithm navigates the search space to find the most efficient path from the start to the goal location.

### Puzzle Solving

Heuristic search algorithms are commonly used to solve puzzles, such as the Eight Puzzle. By evaluating the heuristic value of each state, the algorithm explores the search space to find the shortest path to the goal state, minimizing the number of moves required to solve the puzzle.

## Considerations and Limitations

While heuristic search algorithms offer a principled approach to problem-solving, several considerations and limitations should be taken into account:

- **Effectiveness of Heuristic Functions:** The performance of heuristic search algorithms heavily depends on the accuracy of the heuristic functions employed. Imperfect heuristics may lead to suboptimal solutions or increased computational overhead.

- **Complexity of the Environment:** Heuristic search algorithms may struggle to navigate complex environments with obstacles or constraints that are not fully captured by the heuristic function. In such cases, the algorithm's performance may be suboptimal.

- **Trade-off between Efficiency and Optimality:** Heuristic search algorithms aim to strike a balance between exploration efficiency and solution optimality. While these algorithms prioritize exploration towards promising regions, they may not always guarantee finding the shortest path to the goal.

# Hill Climbing

Hill climbing is a heuristic search algorithm used in artificial intelligence (AI) to solve optimization problems. It is a local search algorithm that aims to find the best possible solution by iteratively moving towards higher-elevation points (better solutions) within a problem space. In this detailed textbook-style overview, we delve into the workings, advantages, disadvantages, and applications of hill climbing algorithms.

## Overview

Hill climbing algorithms are designed to navigate through the search space of a problem by gradually improving upon the current solution. The algorithm begins with an initial solution and iteratively explores neighboring solutions, moving towards the one that maximizes (or minimizes) an objective function, also known as a heuristic evaluation function. The process continues until a local optimum (or maximum) is reached, where no neighboring solution yields a better result.

### Algorithmic Framework

The basic framework of the hill climbing algorithm can be outlined as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial solution $S$.
2. **Main Loop**: Repeat the following steps until no better solution can be found:
   - **Exploration**: Generate neighboring solutions from the current solution $N$.
   - **Evaluation**: Evaluate each neighboring solution using a heuristic function $h(N)$.
   - **Selection**: Move to the neighboring solution $N$ that maximizes (or minimizes) the heuristic function.
3. **Termination**: Return the best solution found.

## Hill-Climbing Algorithm

### Pseudocode

The hill climbing algorithm can be represented in pseudocode as follows:

```
N <- S
do bestEver <- N
N <- head(sort_h(MOVEGEN(bestEver)))
while h(N) is better than h(bestEver)
    bestEver <- N
    N <- head(sort_h(MOVEGEN(bestEver)))
return bestEver
```

Here, $S$ represents the initial solution, $N$ represents the current solution, $h(N)$ is the heuristic evaluation function, and $MOVEGEN$ generates neighboring solutions. The algorithm iteratively updates the current solution to the best neighboring solution until no better solution can be found.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Set $N$ to the initial solution $S$.
2. **Main Loop**: 
   - Set $\text{bestEver}$ to $N$ to keep track of the best solution found so far.
   - Generate neighboring solutions from $\text{bestEver}$ using the $\text{MOVEGEN}$ function.
   - Sort the generated solutions based on the heuristic function $h(N)$ and select the best one as the new current solution $N$.
   - Repeat the process until no better solution can be found.
3. **Termination**: Return the best solution found, stored in $\text{bestEver}$.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Hill climbing is computationally efficient, especially in problems with a large search space, as it only explores neighboring solutions.
- **Simplicity**: The algorithm is straightforward to implement and understand, making it accessible for various optimization tasks.
- **Constant Space Complexity**: It requires constant memory space, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### Disadvantages

- **Local Optima**: Hill climbing algorithms are prone to getting stuck in local optima, failing to find the global optimum if present.
- **Limited Scope**: Due to its greedy nature, hill climbing may overlook better solutions that require moving away from the current solution.
- **Heuristic Dependence**: The effectiveness of hill climbing heavily relies on the quality of the heuristic function used, which may not always accurately guide the search.

## Applications

Hill climbing algorithms find applications in various domains where optimization is required. Some common applications include:

- **Puzzle Solving**: In puzzles like the 8 puzzle or Rubik's cube, hill climbing can be used to find solutions by navigating through the state space.
- **Optimization Problems**: Hill climbing is employed in optimization tasks such as scheduling, routing, and resource allocation to find near-optimal solutions within a limited time frame.

## Extensions and Alternatives

### Deterministic Methods

- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic optimization technique that allows the algorithm to escape local optima by occasionally accepting worse solutions based on a temperature parameter.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Inspired by the process of natural selection, genetic algorithms explore the search space through a population of candidate solutions, allowing for diversity and exploration.

### Randomized Methods

- **Random Restart Hill Climbing**: A variant of hill climbing that periodically restarts the search from different initial solutions to overcome local optima.
- **Tabu Search**: An iterative search method that uses memory structures to avoid revisiting previously explored solutions, enhancing exploration capabilities.

# Solution Space Search

In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), solution space search plays a pivotal role in solving complex problems. This approach involves exploring various potential solutions within a defined search space to find an optimal or satisfactory outcome. In this comprehensive discussion, we delve into the intricacies of solution space search, examining its application in problems such as the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We also explore different search algorithms, perturbation operators, and the complexities associated with these problems.

## Solution Space Search

In the realm of solution space search, the focus is on formulating the problem in such a way that finding the goal node directly corresponds to discovering the solution. This approach simplifies the search process by eliminating the need for reconstructing the solution path.

### Definition
Solution space search involves defining the search problem in a manner where reaching the goal node signifies finding the solution. This formulation streamlines the search process, as each node in the search space represents a potential solution candidate.

### Configuration Problems
Configuration problems align seamlessly with the concept of solution space search, as every node in the search space serves as a candidate solution. The evaluation of candidate solutions is based on their adherence to the goal description.

### Planning Problems
Even planning problems can be tackled using solution space search techniques, wherein each node represents a candidate plan. This approach, known as plan space planning, enables the exploration of various planning strategies to achieve the desired outcome.

## Synthesis vs. Perturbation

In solution space search, two fundamental approaches are employed: synthesis and perturbation. These methods offer distinct strategies for generating and evaluating candidate solutions.

### Synthesis Methods
Synthesis methods adopt a constructive approach, wherein the solution is built incrementally from an initial state. For instance, in problems like the N-Queen problem, the solution is constructed piece by piece, gradually moving towards the goal state.

### Perturbation Methods
Perturbation methods involve modifying existing candidate solutions to explore alternative paths in the search space. By introducing changes such as shuffling arrays or altering solution representations, perturbation techniques generate new candidate solutions for evaluation.

## SAT Problem (Boolean Satisfiability Problem)

The Boolean Satisfiability Problem, commonly referred to as SAT, is a fundamental problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. It involves determining whether a given Boolean formula can be satisfied by assigning truth values to its variables.

### Problem Statement
Given a Boolean formula comprising propositional variables, the task is to find an assignment of truth values to these variables such that the formula evaluates to true. This problem is often studied in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where the formula consists of clauses connected by conjunctions.

### Complexity Analysis
SAT is classified as NP-complete, indicating its high computational complexity. While verifying a solution can be done in polynomial time, finding the solution itself often requires exponential time, rendering brute force approaches impractical for large instances of the problem.

## Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

The Traveling Salesperson Problem is another classic problem in the realm of optimization and combinatorial optimization. It involves finding the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

### Problem Definition
In the TSP, a set of cities is given, along with the distances between each pair of cities. The objective is to determine the optimal tour that minimizes the total distance traveled while visiting each city exactly once.

### Complexity Analysis
TSP is categorized as NP-hard, indicating its high computational complexity similar to SAT. The problem requires factorial time to solve, as the number of possible tours grows exponentially with the number of cities.

## Greedy Constructive Methods for TSP

In tackling the TSP, various heuristic algorithms are employed to construct feasible solutions. Greedy constructive methods prioritize efficiency by iteratively adding elements to the solution based on certain criteria.

### Nearest Neighbor Heuristic
The Nearest Neighbor Heuristic is a simple yet effective approach that starts from a chosen city and iteratively selects the nearest unvisited city as the next destination. While intuitive, this method may not always produce optimal solutions.

### Greedy Heuristic
The Greedy Heuristic operates similarly to Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees. It selects edges with the shortest distance and adds them to the tour, avoiding the creation of smaller loops.

## Savings Heuristic for TSP

The Savings Heuristic is a popular approach for solving the TSP, particularly in scenarios where efficiency is paramount. This method leverages savings in cost to guide the construction of the tour.

### Methodology
The Savings Heuristic begins by creating tours of length 2 anchored on a base vertex. It then performs merge operations to combine these tours, optimizing the total cost while ensuring the connectivity of the tour.

### Implementation
By iteratively merging tours and maximizing cost savings, the Savings Heuristic generates feasible solutions that often exhibit competitive performance compared to other methods.

## Perturbation Operators for TSP

In addition to constructive methods, perturbation operators play a crucial role in exploring alternative solutions within the search space of the TSP. These operators facilitate the generation of diverse candidate solutions through systematic modifications.

### Tour City Exchange
The Tour City Exchange operator involves swapping the positions of two cities in the tour sequence. By rearranging the order of cities, this operator explores different tour configurations within the search space.

### Edge Exchange
Alternatively, the Edge Exchange operator focuses on modifying the edges in the tour rather than the cities themselves. By rearranging the connectivity between cities, this operator aims to improve the overall tour quality.

### Three Edge Exchange
For more significant modifications, the Three Edge Exchange operator removes three edges from the tour and reconstructs the tour based on the remaining connectivity. This operator enables the exploration of alternative tour structures.

## Complexity Analysis of SAT and TSP

Both SAT and TSP pose significant computational challenges due to their inherent complexity and large search spaces. Understanding the computational complexity of these problems is crucial for devising efficient solution approaches.

### SAT Complexity
SAT is classified as NP-complete, indicating that it requires exponential time to solve in the worst case. Despite being verifiable in polynomial time, finding the solution itself often involves exhaustive search or heuristic methods.

### TSP Complexity
Similarly, TSP is categorized as NP-hard, implying that it requires factorial time to solve as

 the problem size increases. The exponential growth in the number of possible tours presents a formidable challenge for exact solution techniques.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of solving SAT and TSP instances is a critical consideration, particularly when dealing with large-scale problem instances. Understanding the computational limitations is essential for selecting appropriate solution strategies.

### SAT Time Complexity
For SAT instances, the time required to find a solution increases exponentially with the number of variables and clauses. Even with efficient algorithms, solving large instances of SAT may require significant computational resources.

### TSP Time Complexity
Similarly, the time complexity of solving TSP instances grows factorially with the number of cities. Despite the existence of heuristic methods, exact solution techniques for TSP remain impractical for instances with a large number of cities.

# Deterministic Local Search

In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), deterministic local search methods aim to navigate solution or plan spaces efficiently, with a focus on avoiding local optima. This section delves into various algorithms designed to tackle this challenge, emphasizing the balance between exploitation and exploration to optimize the search process.

## Exploration in Search

While hill climbing efficiently exploits local gradients, it lacks the capability to explore diverse regions of the search space. To overcome this limitation, exploration becomes imperative. Exploration involves deviating from the current trajectory to uncover new paths that may lead to superior solutions.

### Need for Exploration
- **Escaping Local Optima:** Exploration is necessary to escape local optima and discover potentially better solutions.
- **Heuristic Limitations:** Relying solely on heuristic functions may restrict the search to familiar regions, hindering exploration.
- **Balancing Exploitation and Exploration:** A balanced approach is required to ensure both exploitation and exploration are effectively utilized in the search process.

## Beam Search

Beam search represents a simple yet effective strategy to augment exploration in the search space. Instead of focusing solely on the best neighbor, beam search considers multiple options at each level of the search. By maintaining a beam width parameter, the algorithm keeps track of the best candidate solutions, increasing the likelihood of discovering the goal node.

### Exploration Strategy
- **Consideration of Multiple Candidates:** Beam search diverges from the traditional approach by considering multiple candidate solutions simultaneously.
- **Beam Width Parameter:** The beam width parameter dictates the number of candidates retained at each level of the search.
- **Enhanced Exploration:** By maintaining multiple candidates, beam search explores diverse solution paths, fostering exploration in the search space.

### Pseudocode

1. `OPEN ← S : []`
2. `N ← S`
3. `do bestEver ← N`
    4. **if** `GOAL-TEST(OPEN) = TRUE`
    5. **then** `return goal from OPEN`
    6. **else** `neighbours ← MOVE-GEN(OPEN)`
        7. `OPEN ← take w (sort neighbours)`
        8. `N ← head OPEN` ▷ best in new layer
9. **while** `h(N)` **is better than** `h(bestEver)`
10. `return bestEver`

## Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND)

Variable neighborhood descent offers a sophisticated approach to balance exploitation and exploration by sequentially employing different neighborhood functions. This adaptive strategy allows the algorithm to transition from sparse to denser neighborhoods as the search progresses, effectively navigating the search space while optimizing computational resources.

### Algorithm
- **Sequential Neighborhood Exploration:** VND iteratively explores different neighborhood functions to traverse the search space.
- **Adaptive Strategy:** The algorithm dynamically adjusts the neighborhood density based on the search progress.
- **Optimizing Resource Usage:** By varying neighborhood functions, VND optimizes computational resources while maintaining search efficiency.

### Pseudocode

1. `MoveGenList ← MOVEGEN1 : MOVEGEN2 : ... : MOVEGENn : []`
2. `bestNode ← S`
3. `while MoveGenList is not empty`
   4. `bestNode ← HILL-CLIMBING(bestNode, head MoveGenList)`
   5. `MoveGenList ← tail MoveGenList`
6. `return bestNode`

## Best Neighbor Search

In contrast to traditional hill climbing, which moves only to better neighbors, the best neighbor search algorithm considers moving to the best neighbor regardless of improvement. This approach introduces variability in the search process, potentially leading to exploration of alternative solution paths.

### Exploration Strategy
- **Diverse Solution Paths:** Best neighbor search explores diverse solution paths by considering the best neighbor at each step.
- **Varied Movement:** Unlike traditional hill climbing, which moves strictly to better neighbors, this algorithm allows for movement to any best neighbor, regardless of improvement.

### Pseudocode

1. `N ← S`
2. `bestSeen ← S`
3. **until some termination condition**
    4. `N ← best MOVEGEN(N)`
    5. **if** `N` **is better than** `bestSeen`
        6. `bestSeen ← N` 
7. `return bestSeen`

## Iterated Hill Climbing

Iterated hill climbing presents a randomized approach to local search, leveraging multiple iterations from randomly chosen starting points. By diversifying the starting points, this algorithm enhances exploration, increasing the likelihood of finding global optima.

### Randomized Exploration
- **Diversified Starting Points:** Iterated hill climbing initiates multiple search iterations from random starting points.
- **Exploration Enhancement:** By exploring from different starting points, the algorithm increases the chances of discovering optimal solutions.

### Pseudocode

1. `bestNode ← random candidate solution`
2. `repeat N times`
3. `currentBest ← HILL-CLIMBING(new random candidate solution)`
4. **if** `h(currentBest)` **is better than** `h(bestNode)`
5. `bestNode ← currentBest`
6. `return bestNode`
