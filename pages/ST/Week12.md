title: "Non-Functional System Testing"
---

Non-functional testing is a crucial aspect of software quality assurance, focusing on how a system operates rather than its specific functionalities. It encompasses a variety of tests that evaluate performance, security, reliability, scalability, and other critical aspects of a system's behavior.

# Taxonomy of System Tests

System testing is broadly categorized into two types:

* **Functional Testing:** Assesses whether the system performs its intended functions as specified in the requirements.
* **Non-Functional Testing:** Evaluates the system's operational characteristics, ensuring it meets performance, security, and other non-functional requirements.

Non-functional tests typically begin during the system testing phase and can involve various types:

* **Performance Testing:** Assesses the system's responsiveness, stability, and resource usage under different workloads.
* **Interoperability Testing:** Determines the system's ability to interact with other systems and products.
* **Security Testing:** Evaluates the system's ability to protect data and maintain functionality against unauthorized access and malicious activities.
* **Reliability Testing:** Measures the system's ability to function consistently over extended periods without failures.
* **Scalability Testing:** Verifies the system's ability to handle increasing workloads and user demands without compromising performance.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensures that modifications or updates to the system haven't introduced new defects or regressions in existing functionality.
* **Documentation Testing:** Verifies the accuracy and clarity of user manuals, online help, and other system documentation.
* **Regulatory Testing:** Ensures compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations.

# Interoperability Testing

This testing aims to ensure seamless communication and data exchange between the system and external systems or products. It can involve:

* **Compatibility Testing:** Verifying compatibility with different operating systems, browsers, database servers, and other software or hardware components.
* **Forward Compatibility:** Ensuring the system can work with future versions of other systems or products.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Ensuring the system can work with older versions of other systems or products.

# Security Testing

Security testing aims to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the system protects data and maintains its intended security functionalities. It encompasses testing for:

* **Confidentiality:** Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and processes.
* **Integrity:** Protecting data and processes from unauthorized modification.
* **Availability:** Ensuring authorized users have access to the system and its resources.
* **Authorization and Authentication:** Verifying that only authorized users can access specific functions and data.

Types of security testing techniques include:

* **Access Control Testing:** Verifying that only authorized users have access to the system and its resources.
* **Encryption Testing:** Assessing the effectiveness of encryption and decryption algorithms used to protect data.
* **File Security Testing:** Preventing unauthorized access and reading of sensitive files.
* **Virus Detection Testing:** Ensuring the system is protected from malware and viruses.
* **Backdoor Detection Testing:** Identifying and eliminating any hidden entry points that could be exploited by attackers.
* **Protocol Testing:** Verifying the security of various communication and security protocols used by the system.

# Reliability Tests

Reliability testing evaluates the system's ability to operate continuously over extended periods without failures. It involves:

* **Hardware Reliability:** Assessing the reliability of the hardware components of the system.
* **Software Reliability:** Evaluating the reliability of the software components of the system.
* **Mathematical Analysis Techniques:** Using statistical and mathematical models to predict and analyze system reliability.

# Scalability Tests

Scalability testing assesses the system's ability to handle increasing workloads and user demands without compromising performance. It involves testing the limits of the system in terms of:

* **Data Storage Limitations:** Evaluating the system's ability to store and manage increasing amounts of data.
* **Network Bandwidth Limitations:** Assessing the system's ability to handle increasing network traffic and data transfer demands.
* **Speed Limits (CPU speed):** Evaluating the system's ability to process data and execute tasks efficiently under heavy workloads.

Scalability tests are often performed by extrapolating basic data and simulating increased user loads or data volumes.

# Documentation Testing

Documentation testing ensures that user manuals, online help, and other system documentation are accurate, clear, and easy to understand. It involves:

* **Read Test:** Reviewing the documentation for clarity, organization, flow, and accuracy.
* **Hands-on Test:** Executing the instructions in the documentation to verify their correctness and effectiveness.
* **Functional Test:** Ensuring the system functions as described in the documentation.

Some recommended tests for documentation include:

* **Grammar and Terminology:** Checking for proper grammar and consistent use of technical terms.
* **Graphics and Images:** Ensuring the use of appropriate graphics and images to enhance understanding.
* **Glossary:** Verifying the accuracy and consistency of the glossary terminology.
* **Index:** Checking the accuracy and completeness of the index.
* **Version Consistency:** Ensuring consistency between online and printed versions of the documentation.
* **Installation Procedure Verification:** Executing the installation procedure as described in the documentation.

# Regulatory Testing

Regulatory testing ensures the system complies with relevant industry standards and regulations, which can vary by country and domain. Examples include:

* **CE (Conformite Europeene):** European Union standards for product safety and environmental protection.
* **CSA (Canadian Standards Association):** Canadian standards for product safety and performance.
* **FCC (Federal Communications Commission):** United States regulations for electronic devices and emissions.
* **Aerospace Standards:** Specific standards for safety-critical systems in the aerospace industry.
* **Automotive Standards:** Specific standards for safety-critical systems in the automotive industry.
