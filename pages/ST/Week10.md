These notes explore the intricacies of testing object-oriented (OO) applications, specifically focusing on mutation testing for integration and uncovering common OO faults. We'll delve into various OO concepts, their implications for testing, and strategies for achieving thorough test coverage.

# Mutation Testing for Integration

## Introduction to Mutation Testing

Mutation testing is a powerful technique for evaluating the quality of test suites. It involves introducing small, deliberate changes (mutations) into the source code and then running the test suite against these mutated versions. If the test suite fails to detect a mutation, it indicates a potential weakness in the tests. 

## Integration Mutation

Integration mutation, also known as interface mutation, focuses on testing the interactions between components in an OO system. It primarily targets method calls, examining both the calling (caller) and called (callee) methods.

## OO Concepts Relevant to Integration Testing

Several OO features influence integration testing, including:

* **Encapsulation:** This principle promotes information hiding by restricting access to member variables and methods. Java offers four access levels: private, protected, public, and default (package), each with specific accessibility rules.
* **Class Inheritance:** A subclass inherits variables and methods from its parent class and all ancestors. Subclasses can utilize inherited members directly, override methods to provide specialized behavior, or hide variables to redefine them.
* **Method Overriding:** This feature allows a subclass to redefine an inherited method with the same name, arguments, and return type, providing a different implementation while maintaining the original signature.
* **Variable Hiding:** By defining a variable with the same name and type as an inherited variable, a subclass effectively hides the inherited variable from its scope. 
* **Class Constructors:** These special methods are responsible for initializing objects upon creation, often accepting arguments to set member variables. Constructors are not inherited like regular methods and require explicit invocation using the 'super' keyword.
* **Polymorphism:** Java supports two types of polymorphism:
    * **Polymorphic attributes:** Object references capable of holding objects of various types. 
    * **Polymorphic methods:** Methods that accept parameters of different types by declaring a parameter of type Object. This enables type abstraction.
* **Overloading:** This feature allows multiple methods or constructors within the same class to share the same name but differ in their argument lists (signatures).

## Mutation Operators for OO Features

To effectively test OO features, various mutation operators are available:

* **Access Modifier Change (AMC):** This operator alters the access level of instance variables and methods to test the correctness of accessibility restrictions.
* **Hiding Variable Deletion (HVD):** This operator removes the declaration of an overriding or hiding variable, forcing references to access the parent's version, exposing potential errors in variable usage.
* **Hiding Variable Insertion (HVI):** This operator introduces a new variable declaration that hides an inherited variable, testing the accuracy of references to the overriding variable.
* **Overriding Method Deletion (OMD):** This operator removes the declaration of an overriding method, causing calls to invoke the parent's version, ensuring that method invocations are directed to the intended target.
* **Overriding Method Moving (OMM):** This operator shifts calls to overridden methods within the method body, testing the correct timing of calls to the parent's version.
* **Overridden Method Rename (OMR):** This operator renames the parent's version of an overridden method, checking for unintended consequences caused by the overriding behavior.
* **Super Keyword Deletion (SKD):** This operator removes occurrences of the 'super' keyword, testing the appropriate use of hiding/hidden variables and overriding/overridden methods. 
* **Parent Constructor Deletion (PCD):** This operator eliminates calls to super constructors, forcing the use of the parent's default constructor, testing its correctness in initializing the object's state.
* **Actual Type Change (ATC):** This operator modifies the actual type of a new object in the 'new' statement, ensuring that the object reference behaves correctly with different object types within the same type family.
* **Declared/Parameter Type Change (DTC/PTC):** These operators modify the declared type of a new object or a parameter object to an ancestor type, testing the object's behavior under different declared types. 
* **Reference Type Change (RTC):** This operator replaces the right-hand side of assignment statements with objects of compatible types, testing the handling of interchangeable types descended from the same ancestor.
* **Overloading Method Change (OMC):** This operator swaps the bodies of overloaded methods to check if they are invoked correctly based on their arguments.
* **Overloading Method Deletion (OMD):** This operator removes each overloaded method individually, testing the coverage and correct invocation of overloaded methods. 
* **Argument Order Change (AOC):** This operator reorders the arguments in method invocations to match the signature of another overloaded method, detecting errors in argument order.
* **Argument Number Change (ANC):** This operator alters the number of arguments in method invocations to match another overloaded method, checking for the correct method invocation.
* **'this' Keyword Deletion (TKD):** This operator removes occurrences of the 'this' keyword, ensuring the correct usage of member variables when hidden by local variables or parameters with the same name. 
* **Static Modifier Change (SMC):** This operator adds or removes the 'static' modifier for instance variables, validating the proper usage of instance and class variables.
* **Variable Initialization Deletion (VID):** This operator removes initialization code for member variables, testing their default values and initialization behavior.
* **Default Constructor Deletion (DCD):** This operator removes the declaration of default constructors, ensuring their correct implementation.

**Choosing Mutation Operators:** 

The selection of mutation operators should be tailored to the specific application and its complexities. The provided list serves as a comprehensive reference for identifying relevant operators to target potential weaknesses in the test suite.

# Testing of Object-Oriented Applications

## OO Features and Testing Challenges

Testing OO software presents unique challenges due to features like:

* **Abstraction:** Testing focuses on the connections between components, ensuring their proper interaction and adherence to the intended design.
* **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** These features introduce dynamic and vertical integration, creating complex relationships between classes and methods. This requires thorough testing of how objects of different types interact with each other.

## Levels of Class Testing 

Testing OO applications involves four levels:

* **Intra-method testing:** Focuses on individual methods within a class (traditional unit testing). 
* **Inter-method testing:** Tests the interactions between multiple methods within a class (traditional module testing). 
* **Intra-class testing:** Tests the behavior of a single class as a whole, typically through sequences of method calls.
* **Inter-class testing:** Evaluates the interactions between multiple classes (similar to integration testing). 

## Visualization with Yo-Yo Graph

The Yo-Yo graph is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamic interactions between methods in an inheritance hierarchy. It represents methods as nodes and method calls as edges. The graph includes levels representing the actual method calls made for objects of specific types, illustrating the potential for control flow to "yo-yo" between different levels of the hierarchy due to polymorphism and dynamic binding. 

## Potential Faults in OO Programs

OO programs are susceptible to various faults arising from their inherent complexities:

* **Inconsistent Type Use (ITU):** Occurs when an object is used as both its declared type and its ancestor type, leading to inconsistencies due to methods in the ancestor type potentially putting the object in a state incompatible with its descendant type.
* **State Definition Anomaly (SDA):** Arises when a descendant class overrides methods without properly defining all the state variables required by the overridden methods, leading to potential data flow anomalies.
* **State Definition Inconsistency Anomaly (SDIH):** Occurs when a local variable in a descendant class hides an inherited variable with the same name, potentially causing incorrect references and data flow anomalies. 
* **State Visibility Anomaly (SVA):** Occurs when a descendant class attempts to access a private variable of an ancestor class, leading to data flow anomalies and potential runtime errors.
* **State Defined Incorrectly:** Arises when an overriding method defines the same state variable as the overridden method, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the computations differ.
* **Indirect Inconsistent State Definition:** Occurs when a descendant class introduces a new method that defines an inherited state variable, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the object's state.

## OO Coupling: Testing Goals and Coverage Criteria

Testing OO applications requires careful consideration of coupling between methods and the potential for indirect definitions and uses of variables due to polymorphism. Key testing goals include:

* **Understanding method interactions with objects of different types.** 
* **Considering all possible type bindings and polymorphic call sets.**
* **Testing all couplings with every possible type substitution.**

**OO Coupling Coverage Criteria:**

* **All-Coupling Sequences (ACS):** Requires at least one test case to execute each coupling sequence in a method, ensuring basic coverage of method interactions.
* **All-Poly-Classes (APC):** Mandates testing each coupling sequence with at least one test case for each class in the family of types defined by the context of the coupling sequence, ensuring coverage for different type bindings and polymorphic behavior.
* **All-Coupling Defs-Uses (ACDU):** Requires each last definition of a coupling variable to reach every first use within a method, ensuring comprehensive data flow coverage.
* **All-Poly-Coupling Defs-and-Uses (APDU):** Combines the previous criteria, requiring each last definition of a coupling variable to reach every first use for each possible type binding, offering the most rigorous coverage for OO interactions and data flow.

# Conclusions

Testing OO applications demands specialized techniques and a deep understanding of OO concepts and their implications. By leveraging tools like the Yo-Yo graph and employing appropriate coverage criteria, we can effectively identify and mitigate potential faults arising from inheritance, polymorphism, and other OO features. Mutation testing further enhances the quality and effectiveness of test suites by revealing weaknesses and promoting thorough coverage. Through careful planning and execution, we can ensure the reliability and robustness of our OO applications.
