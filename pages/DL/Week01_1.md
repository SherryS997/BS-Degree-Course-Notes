# A Historical Overview of Deep Learning

## Biological Neurons and Theories
In the early stages of understanding neural networks, Joseph von Gerlach's 1871 proposition of the Reticular theory posited a continuous network for the nervous system. Supporting evidence came from Golgi's staining technique. The debate shifted with Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal's 1891 Neuron doctrine, proposing discrete individual cells forming a network. This sparked the Nobel Prize conflict in 1906, ultimately resolved through electron microscopy. The ensuing discourse revolved around the balance between localized and distributed processing in the brain.

## Artificial Neurons and the Perceptron
In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts presented a model of the neuron, laying the groundwork for artificial neurons. A significant stride occurred in 1957 when Frank Rosenblatt introduced the perceptron model, featuring weighted inputs. However, the limitations of a single perceptron were identified by Minsky and Papert in 1969.

## Spring to Winter of AI
The period from 1957 to 1969 marked the "Spring of AI," characterized by optimism, funding, and interest. Yet, Minsky and Papert's critique ushered in the "Winter of AI." The emergence of backpropagation in 1986, popularized by Rumelhart and Hinton, and the acknowledgment of gradient descent (discovered by Cauchy in the 19th century) marked a shift in the AI landscape.

## Universal Approximation Theorem
The Universal Approximation Theorem, introduced in 1989, elucidates how a multi-layered neural network can approximate any function. Emphasis is placed on the significance of the number of neurons for achieving superior approximation.

## Practical Challenges and Progress
A disparity between theoretical knowledge and practical challenges in training deep neural networks emerged. Stability and convergence issues with backpropagation were identified in practice. However, progress in convolutional neural networks over two decades has been noteworthy.
